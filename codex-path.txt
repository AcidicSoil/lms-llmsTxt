Ran the requested environment check. Key results: `pwd` is `/mnt/c/Users/user/projects/WIP/lms-llmsTxt-generator`; `PATH` includes Homebrew and user-local bins; `node` and `npm` resolve to `/home/linuxbrew/.linuxbrew/bin/node` and `/home/linuxbrew/.linuxbrew/bin/npm`; first 50 env vars printed (see command output above). Let me know if you need anything else from the environment.
