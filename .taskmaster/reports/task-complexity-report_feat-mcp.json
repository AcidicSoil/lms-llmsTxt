			"complexityScore": 8,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 6,
			"expansionPrompt": "Identify and break down the necessary changes for Task 11 into granular steps. Ensure you cover the following areas: 1) Updating the RunRecord model to track state, 2) Creating a thread-safe RunStore update mechanism, 3) Implementing a background execution wrapper (e.g., using anyio or threading), 4) Refactoring the FastMCP tool to handle immediate returns and background task spawning, 5) Updating resource resolvers to provide status-aware responses, and 6) Implementing a safe cleanup/pruning routine for in-memory records.",
			"reasoning": "This task is highly complex as it fundamentally changes the server's execution model from synchronous/blocking to asynchronous/non-blocking for long-running tool calls. It requires managing concurrency safely (thread-safety in the RunStore), handling background task lifecycles (including error capture and state propagation), and modifying the MCP resource resolution logic to handle intermediate states ('Processing'). The high score reflects the risks associated with background thread management, potential race conditions in the shared registry, and the need to ensure standard MCP clients correctly handle 'immediate-response-with-id' patterns."
