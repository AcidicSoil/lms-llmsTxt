# Cycles?Tab=Readme Ov File

> The purpose of Cycles is to enable users to render highly realistic 3D scenes using physically accurate lighting models and advanced rendering techniques such as path tracing and importance sampling. It aims to provide a balance between quality and performance across different hardware platforms while supporting complex material systems and global illumination. The project also serves as a research and development platform for next-generation rendering algorithms.

**Remember:**
- Physically-based rendering
- Path tracing
- Global illumination
- Importance sampling
- Material shaders
- Radiosity
