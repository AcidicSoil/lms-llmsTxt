# AI Crew for Landing Pages
## Introduction
This project is an example using the CrewAI framework to automate the process of creating landing pages from a single idea. CrewAI orchestrates autonomous AI agents, enabling them to collaborate and execute complex tasks efficiently.

*Disclaimer: Templates are not included as they are Tailwind templates. Place Tailwind individual template folders in `./templates`, if you have a lincese you can download them at (https://tailwindui.com/templates), their references are at `config/templates.json`, this was not tested this with other templates, prompts in `tasks.py` might require some changes for that to work.*

## CrewAI Framework
CrewAI is designed to facilitate the collaboration of role-playing AI agents. In this example, these agents work together to transform an idea into a fully fleshed-out landing page by expanding the idea, choosing a template, and customizing it to fit the concept.

## Running the Script
It uses GPT-4 by default so you should have access to that to run it.

***Disclaimer:** This will use gpt-4 unless you changed it 
not to, and by doing so it will cost you money (~2-9 USD).
The full run might take around ~10-45m. Enjoy your time back*


- **Configure Environment**: Copy ``.env.example` and set up the environment variables for [Browseless](https://www.browserless.io/), [Serper](https://serper.dev/) and [OpenAI](https://platform.openai.com/api-keys)
- **Install Dependencies**: Run `poetry install --no-root`.
- **Add Tailwind Templates**: Place Tailwind individual template folders in `./templates`, if you have a linces you can download them at (https://tailwindui.com/templates), their references are at `config/templates.json`, I haven't tested this with other templates, prompts in `tasks.py` might require some changes for that to work.
- **Execute the Script**: Run `poetry run python main.py` and input your idea.

## Details & Explanation
- **Running the Script**: Execute `python main.py`` and input your idea when prompted. The script will leverage the CrewAI framework to process the idea and generate a landing page.
- **Output**: The generated landing page will be zipped in the a `workdir.zip` file you can download.
- **Key Components**:
  - `./main.py`: Main script file.
  - `./tasks.py`: Main file with the tasks prompts.
  - `./tools`: Contains tool classes used by the agents.
  - `./config`: Configuration files for agents.
  - `./templates`: Directory to store Tailwind templates (not included).

## Using GPT 3.5
CrewAI allow you to pass an llm argument to the agent construtor, that will be it's brain, so changing the agent to use GPT-3.5 instead of GPT-4 is as simple as passing that argument on the agent you want to use that LLM (in `main.py`).
```python
from langchain.chat_models import ChatOpenAI

llm = ChatOpenAI(model='gpt-3.5') # Loading GPT-3.5

self.idea_analyst = Agent(
    **idea_analyst_config,
    verbose=True,
    llm=llm, # <----- passing our llm reference here
    tools=[
        SearchTools.search_internet,
        BrowserTools.scrape_and_summarize_kwebsite
    ]
)
```

## Using Local Models with Ollama
The CrewAI framework supports integration with local models, such as Ollama, for enhanced flexibility and customization. This allows you to utilize your own models, which can be particularly useful for specialized tasks or data privacy concerns.

### Setting Up Ollama
- **Install Ollama**: Ensure that Ollama is properly installed in your environment. Follow the installation guide provided by Ollama for detailed instructions.
- **Configure Ollama**: Set up Ollama to work with your local model. You will probably need to [tweak the model using a Modelfile](https://github.com/jmorganca/ollama/blob/main/docs/modelfile.md), I'd recommend adding `Observation` as a stop word and playing with `top_p` and `temperature`.

### Integrating Ollama with CrewAI
- Instantiate Ollama Model: Create an instance of the Ollama model. You can specify the model and the base URL during instantiation. For example:

```python
from langchain.llms import Ollama
ollama_openhermes = Ollama(model="agent")
# Pass Ollama Model to Agents: When creating your agents within the CrewAI framework, you can pass the Ollama model as an argument to the Agent constructor. For instance:

self.idea_analyst = Agent(
    **idea_analyst_config,
    verbose=True,
    llm=ollama_openhermes, # Ollama model passed here
    tools=[
        SearchTools.search_internet,
        BrowserTools.scrape_and_summarize_website
    ]
)
```

### Advantages of Using Local Models
- **Privacy**: Local models allow processing of data within your own infrastructure, ensuring data privacy.
- **Customization**: You can customize the model to better suit the specific needs of your tasks.
- **Performance**: Depending on your setup, local models can offer performance benefits, especially in terms of latency.

# Email Auto Responder Flow

Welcome to the Email Auto Responder Flow project, powered by [crewAI](https://crewai.com). This example demonstrates how you can leverage Flows from crewAI to automate the process of checking emails and creating draft responses. By utilizing Flows, the process becomes much simpler and more efficient.

## Background

In this project, we've taken one of our old example repositories, [CrewAI-LangGraph](https://github.com/crewAIInc/crewAI-examples/tree/main/CrewAI-LangGraph), and repurposed it to now use Flows. This showcases the power and simplicity of Flows in orchestrating AI agents to automate tasks like checking emails and creating drafts. Flows provide a more straightforward and powerful alternative to LangGraph, making it easier to build and manage complex workflows.

### High-Level Diagram

Below is a high-level diagram of the Email Auto Responder Flow:

![High-level Diagram](./Email_Flow.png)

This diagram illustrates the flow of tasks from fetching new emails to generating draft responses.

## Overview

This flow will guide you through the process of setting up an automated email responder. Here's a brief overview of what will happen in this flow:

1. **Fetch New Emails**: The flow starts by using the `EmailFilterCrew` to check for new emails. It updates the state with any new emails and their IDs.

2. **Generate Draft Responses**: Once new emails are fetched, the flow formats these emails and uses the `EmailFilterCrew` to generate draft responses for each email.

This flow is a great example of using Flows as a background worker that runs continuously to help you out. By following this flow, you can efficiently automate the process of checking emails and generating draft responses, leveraging the power of multiple AI agents to handle different aspects of the email processing workflow.

## Installation

Ensure you have Python >=3.10 <=3.13 installed on your system. First, if you haven't already, install CrewAI:

```bash
pip install crewai==0.130.0
```

Next, navigate to your project directory and install the dependencies:

1. First lock the dependencies and then install them:

```bash
crewai install
```

### Customizing & Dependencies

**Add your `OPENAI_API_KEY` into the `.env` file**  
**Add your `SERPER_API_KEY` into the `.env` file**  
**Add your `TAVILY_API_KEY` into the `.env` file**  
**Add your `MY_EMAIL` into the `.env` file**

To customize the behavior of the email auto responder, you can update the agents and tasks defined in the `EmailFilterCrew`. If you want to adjust the flow itself, you will need to modify the flow in `main.py`.

- **Agents and Tasks**: Modify `src/email_auto_responder_flow/crews/email_filter_crew/email_filter_crew.py` to define your agents and tasks. This is where you can customize how emails are filtered and how draft responses are generated.

- **Flow Adjustments**: Modify `src/email_auto_responder_flow/main.py` to adjust the flow. This is where you can change how the flow orchestrates the different crews and tasks.

### Setting Up Google Credentials

To enable the email auto responder to access your Gmail account, you need to set up a `credentials.json` file. Follow these steps:

1. **Set Up Google Account**: Follow the [Google instructions](https://developers.google.com/gmail/api/quickstart/python#authorize_credentials_for_a_desktop_application) to set up your Google account and obtain the `credentials.json` file.

2. **Download and Place `credentials.json`**: Once you’ve downloaded the file, name it `credentials.json` and place it in the root of the project.

## Running the Project

To kickstart your crew of AI agents and begin task execution, run this from the root folder of your project:

```bash
uv run kickoff
```

This command initializes the email_auto_responder_flow, assembling the agents and assigning them tasks as defined in your configuration.

When you kickstart the flow, it will orchestrate multiple crews to perform the tasks. The flow will first fetch new emails, then create and run a crew to generate draft responses.

## Understanding Your Flow

The email_auto_responder_flow is composed of multiple AI agents, each with unique roles, goals, and tools. These agents collaborate on a series of tasks, defined in `config/tasks.yaml`, leveraging their collective skills to achieve complex objectives. The `config/agents.yaml` file outlines the capabilities and configurations of each agent in your flow.

### Flow Structure

1. **EmailFilterCrew**: This crew is responsible for checking for new emails and updating the state with any new emails and their IDs.

2. **Generate Draft Responses**: Once new emails are fetched, this step formats the emails and uses the `EmailFilterCrew` to generate draft responses for each email.

By understanding the flow structure, you can see how multiple crews are orchestrated to work together, each handling a specific part of the email processing workflow. This modular approach allows for efficient and scalable email automation.

# Self Evaluation Loop Flow

Welcome to the Self Evaluation Loop Flow project, powered by [crewAI](https://crewai.com). This project showcases a powerful pattern in AI workflows: automatic self-evaluation. By leveraging crewAI's multi-agent system, this flow demonstrates how to set up a Crew that evaluates the responses of other Crews, iterating with feedback to improve results.

## Overview

This flow guides you through setting up an automated self-evaluation system using two main Crews: the `ShakespeareanXPostCrew` and the `XPostReviewCrew`. The process involves the following steps:

1. **Generate Initial Output**: The `ShakespeareanXPostCrew` generates an initial Shakespearean-style post (X post) on a given topic, such as "Flying cars". This post is crafted to be humorous and playful, adhering to specific character limits and style guidelines.

2. **Evaluate Output**: The `XPostReviewCrew` evaluates the generated post to ensure it meets the required criteria, such as character count and absence of emojis. The crew provides feedback on the post's validity and quality.

3. **Iterate with Feedback**: If the post does not meet the criteria, the flow iterates by regenerating the post with the feedback provided. This iterative process continues until the post is valid or a maximum retry limit is reached.

4. **Finalize and Save**: Once the post is validated, it is finalized and saved for further use. If the maximum retry count is exceeded without achieving a valid post, the flow exits with the last generated post and feedback.

This pattern of automatic self-evaluation is crucial for developing robust AI systems that can adapt and improve over time, ensuring high-quality outputs through iterative refinement.

## Installation

Ensure you have Python >=3.10 <=3.13 installed on your system.

To install CrewAI, run the following command:

```bash
pip install crewai==0.130.0
```

You need to access your email inbox to read incoming emails. Here’s a basic example of how to use an email library like `imaplib` to read emails:

```python
import imaplib
import email

# Connect to the server
mail = imaplib.IMAP4_SSL('imap.gmail.com')

# Login to your account
mail.login('your-email@gmail.com', 'your-password')

# Select the mailbox you want to check
mail.select('inbox')

# Search for all emails in the inbox
status, messages = mail.search(None, 'ALL')

# Convert messages to a list of email IDs
email_ids = messages[0].split()

# Fetch the latest email
status, msg_data = mail.fetch(email_ids[-1], '(RFC822)')

# Parse the email content
msg = email.message_from_bytes(msg_data[0][1])

# Print the subject of the email
print(msg['subject'])
```

#### Step 2: Categorizing Emails

Next, categorize the emails using CrewAI’s natural language processing capabilities. For simplicity, let’s assume you are categorizing emails into "urgent," "normal," and "spam."

```python
from crewai import CrewAI

# Initialize CrewAI
crew = CrewAI(api_key='your-crewai-api-key')

def categorize_email(subject):
    response = crew.classify_text(subject)
    return response['category']

subject = msg['subject']
category = categorize_email(subject)
print(f"Email Category: {category}")
```

#### Step 3: Generating Responses

Once the email is categorized, you can generate an appropriate response. CrewAI can assist in generating context-specific responses.

```python
def generate_response(category):
    if category == 'urgent':
        response = "Thank you for your urgent email. We will get back to you shortly."
    elif category == 'normal':
        response = "Thank you for your email. We will respond at our earliest convenience."
    elif category == 'spam':
        response = "This email has been marked as spam."
    else:
        response = "Thank you for your email."
    return response

response_text = generate_response(category)
print(f"Generated Response: {response_text}")
```

#### Step 4: Sending Responses

Finally, send the generated response back to the sender using an email sending library like `smtplib`.

```python
import smtplib
from email.mime.text import MIMEText

def send_email_response(to_email, subject, body):
    # Setup the MIME
    message = MIMEText(body, 'plain')
    message['From'] = 'your-email@gmail.com'
    message['To'] = to_email
    message['Subject'] = f"Re: {subject}"

    # Use the SMTP server to send the email
    server = smtplib.SMTP('smtp.gmail.com', 587)
    server.starttls()
    server.login('your-email@gmail.com', 'your-password')
    server.sendmail('your-email@gmail.com', to_email, message.as_string())
    server.quit()

send_email_response(msg['from'], msg['subject'], response_text)
```

This example covers the basic workflow of reading an email, categorizing it, generating a response, and sending it back to the sender using CrewAI.

**Note:** For a production environment, you should use environment variables or secure vaults to manage sensitive information like email credentials and API keys.

### Task Breakdown

1. **Reading Emails:** The AI agent reads incoming emails and categorizes them based on pre-defined criteria (e.g., urgency, subject matter).
2. **Generating Responses:** The agent uses templates and machine learning models to generate appropriate responses.
3. **Sending Emails:** The agent sends the generated responses to the respective recipients.

### Implementation

#### Step 1: Reading Emails

You need to access your email inbox to read incoming emails. Here’s a basic example of how to use an email library like `imaplib` to read emails:

```python
import imaplib
import email

# Connect to the server
mail = imaplib.IMAP4_SSL('imap.gmail.com')

# Login to your account
mail.login('your-email@gmail.com', 'your-password')

# Select the mailbox you want to check
mail.select('inbox')

# Search for all emails in the inbox
status, messages = mail.search(None, 'ALL')

# Convert messages to a list of email IDs
email_ids = messages[0].split()

# Fetch the latest email
status, msg_data = mail.fetch(email_ids[-1], '(RFC822)')

# Parse the email content
msg = email.message_from_bytes(msg_data[0][1])

# Print the subject of the email
print(msg['subject'])
```

#### Step 2: Categorizing Emails

Next, categorize the emails using CrewAI’s natural language processing capabilities. For simplicity, let’s assume you are categorizing emails into "urgent," "normal," and "spam."

```python
from crewai import CrewAI

# Initialize CrewAI
crew = CrewAI(api_key='your-crewai-api-key')

def categorize_email(subject):
    response = crew.classify_text(subject)
    return response['category']

subject = msg['subject']
category = categorize_email(subject)
print(f"Email Category: {category}")
```

#### Step 3: Generating Responses

Once the email is categorized, you can generate an appropriate response. CrewAI can assist in generating context-specific responses.

```python
def generate_response(category):
    if category == 'urgent':
        response = "Thank you for your urgent email. We will get back to you shortly."
    elif category == 'normal':
        response = "Thank you for your email. We will respond at our earliest convenience."
    elif category == 'spam':
        response = "This email has been marked as spam."
    else:
        response = "Thank you for your email."
    return response

response_text = generate_response(category)
print(f"Generated Response: {response_text}")
```

#### Step 4: Sending Responses

Finally, send the generated response back to the sender using an email sending library like `smtplib`.

```python
import smtplib
from email.mime.text import MIMEText

def send_email_response(to_email, subject, body):
    # Setup the MIME
    message = MIMEText(body, 'plain')
    message['From'] = 'your-email@gmail.com'
    message['To'] = to_email
    message['Subject'] = f"Re: {subject}"

    # Use the SMTP server to send the email
    server = smtplib.SMTP('smtp.gmail.com', 587)
    server.starttls()
    server.login('your-email@gmail.com', 'your-password')
    server.sendmail('your-email@gmail.com', to_email, message.as_string())
    server.quit()

send_email_response(msg['from'], msg['subject'], response_text)
```

This example covers the basic workflow of reading an email, categorizing it, generating a response, and sending it back to the sender using CrewAI.

#### Workflow Management

Use CrewAI's workflow management features to sequence tasks and ensure smooth execution. This includes setting up triggers and conditions for task execution.

## Real-World Example: Automating Email Responses

To demonstrate the power of CrewAI, let's walk through a real-world example of automating email responses. This example will cover reading emails, categorizing them, generating responses, and sending the responses.

### Task Breakdown

1. **Reading Emails:** The AI agent reads incoming emails and categorizes them based on pre-defined criteria (e.g., urgency, subject matter).
2. **Generating Responses:** The agent uses templates and machine learning models to generate appropriate responses.
3. **Sending Emails:** The agent sends the generated responses to the respective recipients.

### Implementation

#### Step 1: Reading Emails

You need to access your email inbox to read incoming emails. Here’s a basic example of how to use an email library like `imaplib` to read emails:

```python
import imaplib
import email

# Connect to the server
mail = imaplib.IMAP4_SSL('imap.gmail.com')

# Login to your account
mail.login('your-email@gmail.com', 'your-password')

# Select the mailbox you want to check
mail.select('inbox')

# Search for all emails in the inbox
status, messages = mail.search(None, 'ALL')

# Convert messages to a list of email IDs
email_ids = messages[0].split()

# Fetch the latest email
status, msg_data = mail.fetch(email_ids[-1], '(RFC822)')

# Parse the email content
msg = email.message_from_bytes(msg_data[0][1])

# Print the subject of the email
print(msg['subject'])
```

#### Step 2: Categorizing Emails

Next, categorize the emails using CrewAI’s natural language processing capabilities. For simplicity, let’s assume you are categorizing emails into "urgent," "normal," and "spam."

```python
from crewai import CrewAI

# Initialize CrewAI
crew = CrewAI(api_key='your-crewai-api-key')

def categorize_email(subject):
    response = crew.classify_text(subject)
    return response['category']

subject = msg['subject']
category = categorize_email(subject)
print(f"Email Category: {category}")
```

#### Step 3: Generating Responses

Once the email is categorized, you can generate an appropriate response. CrewAI can assist in generating context-specific responses.

```python
def generate_response(category):
    if category == 'urgent':
        response = "Thank you for your urgent email. We will get back to you shortly."
    elif category == 'normal':
        response = "Thank you for your email. We will respond at our earliest convenience."
    elif category == 'spam':
        response = "This email has been marked as spam."
    else:
        response = "Thank you for your email."
    return response

response_text = generate_response(category)
print(f"Generated Response: {response_text}")
```

#### Step 4: Sending Responses

Finally, send the generated response back to the sender using an email sending library like `smtplib`.

```python
import smtplib
from email.mime.text import MIMEText

def send_email_response(to_email, subject, body):
    # Setup the MIME
    message = MIMEText(body, 'plain')
    message['From'] = 'your-email@gmail.com'
    message['To'] = to_email
    message['Subject'] = f"Re: {subject}"

    # Use the SMTP server to send the email
    server = smtplib.SMTP('smtp.gmail.com', 587)
    server.starttls()
    server.login('your-email@gmail.com', 'your-password')

# AI Crew for Marketing Strategy using NVIDIA NIM Endpoint
## Introduction
This project demonstrates the use of the CrewAI framework to automate the creation of a marketing strategy. CrewAI orchestrates autonomous AI agents powered by NVIDIA LLM endpoints, enabling them to collaborate and execute complex tasks efficiently.

By [@joaomdmoura](https://x.com/joaomdmoura)

- [NVIDIA NIM](https://docs.api.nvidia.com/?ncid=no-ncid)
- [langchain-nvidia-ai-endpoints](https://github.com/langchain-ai/langchain-nvidia)

# NVIDIA NIMs

The `langchain-nvidia-ai-endpoints` package contains LangChain integrations building applications with models on
NVIDIA NIM inference microservice. NIM supports models across domains like chat, embedding, and re-ranking models
from the community as well as NVIDIA. These models are optimized by NVIDIA to deliver the best performance on NVIDIA
accelerated infrastructure and deployed as a NIM, an easy-to-use, prebuilt containers that deploy anywhere using a single
command on NVIDIA accelerated infrastructure.

NVIDIA hosted deployments of NIMs are available to test on the [NVIDIA API catalog](https://build.nvidia.com/). After testing,
NIMs can be exported from NVIDIA’s API catalog using the NVIDIA AI Enterprise license and run on-premises or in the cloud,
giving enterprises ownership and full control of their IP and AI application.

NIMs are packaged as container images on a per model basis and are distributed as NGC container images through the NVIDIA NGC Catalog.
At their core, NIMs provide easy, consistent, and familiar APIs for running inference on an AI model.

This example goes over how to use LangChain to interact with NVIDIA supported via the `ChatNVIDIA` class.

For more information on accessing the chat models through this api, check out the [ChatNVIDIA](https://python.langchain.com/docs/integrations/chat/nvidia_ai_endpoints/) documentation.

## CrewAI Framework
CrewAI is designed to facilitate the collaboration of role-playing AI agents. In this example, these agents work together to create a comprehensive marketing strategy and develop compelling marketing content.

## Running the Script
It uses meta/llama-3.1-8b-instruct by default so you should have access to that to run it.

***Disclaimer:** This will use gpt-4o unless you change it to use a different model, and by doing so it may incur in different costs.*

- **Configure Environment**: Copy `.env.example` and set up the environment variables for [NVIDIA](https://build.nvidia.com) and other tools as needed, like [Serper](serper.dev).
- **Install Dependencies**: Run `make install`.
- **Customize**: Modify `src/marketing_posts/main.py` to add custom inputs for your agents and tasks.
- **Customize Further**: Check `src/marketing_posts/config/agents.yaml` to update your agents and `src/marketing_posts/config/tasks.yaml` to update your tasks.
- **Execute the Script**: Run `poetry run marketing_posts` and input your project details.

## Details & Explanation
- **Running the Script**: Execute `poetry run marketing_posts`. The script will leverage the CrewAI framework to generate a detailed marketing strategy.
- **Key Components**:
  - `src/marketing_posts/main.py`: Main script file.
  - `src/marketing_posts/crew.py`: Main crew file where agents and tasks come together, and the main logic is executed.
  - `src/marketing_posts/config/agents.yaml`: Configuration file for defining agents.
  - `src/marketing_posts/config/tasks.yaml`: Configuration file for defining tasks.
  - `src/marketing_posts/tools`: Contains tool classes used by the agents.

    "**Class Overview**\n",
    "\n",
    "- `ContentRouterFlow` is a **subclass of `Flow[ContentState]`** that implements an event-driven workflow for dynamic content creation routing. It demonstrates CrewAI's Flow architecture with state management and specialized crew routing.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Key Decorators & Their Roles\n",
    "\n",
    "**💾 `@persist()`**\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Purpose**: Enables automatic state persistence across workflow execution\n",
    "- **Behavior**: Saves flow state to SQLite database by default\n",
    "- **Benefits**: Workflow recovery, state tracking, and debugging capabilities\n",
    "- **Scope**: Applied at class level to persist all method states\n",
    "\n",
    "**🚀 `@start()`**\n",
    "- **Purpose**: Marks the workflow entry point\n",
    "- **Function**: Collects user input (URL + content type) and initializes state\n",
    "- **Triggers**: Automatic when flow begins\n",
    "\n",
    "**🧭 `@router(get_user_input)`**\n",
    "- **Purpose**: Creates decision point for workflow routing\n",
    "- **Logic**: Returns `self.state.content_type` to determine next path\n",
    "- **Output**: Routes to \"blog\", \"newsletter\", or \"linkedin\" listeners\n",
    "\n",
    "**👂 `@listen(\"event_name\")`**\n",
    "- **Purpose**: Creates event listeners for specific triggers\n",
    "- **Behavior**: Methods execute when their specified event occurs\n",
    "- **Examples**: `@listen(\"blog\")`, `@listen(\"newsletter\")`, `@listen(\"linkedin\")`\n",
    "\n",
    "## Workflow:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. The workflow starts with **`@start()`** on **`get_user_input()`**.\n",
    "2. The result of **`get_user_input()`** is routed by **`@router()`** to one of the `process_*_content` methods based on the content_type.\n",
    "3. Whichever `process_*_content` method runs (e.g., `process_blog_content`), it will eventually complete and save the result to the flow's state."
