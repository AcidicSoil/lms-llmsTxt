# Onecontext

> OneContext aims to unify context across all AI agents within a team, allowing them to maintain and share trajectories for consistent, uninterrupted work. It enables users to import past sessions (e.g., from Codex or Claude), resume tasks from previous states, and collaborate in real time via Slack — all while maintaining agent continuity regardless of device or session. The tool is built for developers and teams managing multiple AI agents, enhancing efficiency through shared context and automation.

**Remember:**
- Agent Self-Managed Context
- Unified Context Layer
- AI Agent Trajectory
- Context Sharing via Slack
- Cross-Session Continuity
- Codex/Claude Session Import
