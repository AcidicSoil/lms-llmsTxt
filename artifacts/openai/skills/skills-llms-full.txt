          notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside

      You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and
      may provide additional or different license terms and conditions
      for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or
      for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,
      reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with
      the conditions stated in this License.

   5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,
      any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work
      by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of
      this License, without any additional terms or conditions.
      Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify
      the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed
      with Licensor regarding such Contributions.

   6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade
      names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,
      except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the
      origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.

   7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or
      agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each
      Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS,
      WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or
      implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions
      of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A
      PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the
      appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any
      risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.

   8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,
      whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,
      unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly
      negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
      liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
      incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
      result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
      Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
      work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
      other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
      has been advised of the possibility of such damages.

   9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing
      the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,
      and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,
      or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this
      License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only
      on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf
      of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,
      defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability
      incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason
      of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.

   END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS

description: Install Codex skills into $CODEX_HOME/skills from a curated list or a GitHub repo path. Use when a user asks to list installable skills, install a curated skill, or install a skill from another repo (including private repos).

  short-description: Install curated skills from openai/skills or other repos
---

# Skill Installer

Helps install skills. By default these are from https://github.com/openai/skills/tree/main/skills/.curated, but users can also provide other locations. Experimental skills live in https://github.com/openai/skills/tree/main/skills/.experimental and can be installed the same way.

Use the helper scripts based on the task:
- List skills when the user asks what is available, or if the user uses this skill without specifying what to do. Default listing is `.curated`, but you can pass `--path skills/.experimental` when they ask about experimental skills.
- Install from the curated list when the user provides a skill name.
- Install from another repo when the user provides a GitHub repo/path (including private repos).

Install skills with the helper scripts.

## Communication

When listing skills, output approximately as follows, depending on the context of the user's request. If they ask about experimental skills, list from `.experimental` instead of `.curated` and label the source accordingly:
"""
Skills from {repo}:
1. skill-1
2. skill-2 (already installed)
3. ...
Which ones would you like installed?
"""

After installing a skill, tell the user: "Restart Codex to pick up new skills."

## Scripts

All of these scripts use network, so when running in the sandbox, request escalation when running them.

- `scripts/list-skills.py` (prints skills list with installed annotations)
- `scripts/list-skills.py --format json`
- Example (experimental list): `scripts/list-skills.py --path skills/.experimental`
- `scripts/install-skill-from-github.py --repo <owner>/<repo> --path <path/to/skill> [<path/to/skill> ...]`
- `scripts/install-skill-from-github.py --url https://github.com/<owner>/<repo>/tree/<ref>/<path>`
- Example (experimental skill): `scripts/install-skill-from-github.py --repo openai/skills --path skills/.experimental/<skill-name>`

## Behavior and Options

- Defaults to direct download for public GitHub repos.
- If download fails with auth/permission errors, falls back to git sparse checkout.
- Aborts if the destination skill directory already exists.
- Installs into `$CODEX_HOME/skills/<skill-name>` (defaults to `~/.codex/skills`).
- Multiple `--path` values install multiple skills in one run, each named from the path basename unless `--name` is supplied.
- Options: `--ref <ref>` (default `main`), `--dest <path>`, `--method auto|download|git`.

## Notes

- Curated listing is fetched from `https://github.com/openai/skills/tree/main/skills/.curated` via the GitHub API. If it is unavailable, explain the error and exit.
- Private GitHub repos can be accessed via existing git credentials or optional `GITHUB_TOKEN`/`GH_TOKEN` for download.
- Git fallback tries HTTPS first, then SSH.
- The skills at https://github.com/openai/skills/tree/main/skills/.system are preinstalled, so no need to help users install those. If they ask, just explain this. If they insist, you can download and overwrite.
- Installed annotations come from `$CODEX_HOME/skills`.

# Example: How-To Guide from Discussion

**User Request**: "Save our discussion about deploying to production as a how-to guide"

## Workflow

### 1. Extract Content from Chat
From conversation, identified:
- Deployment prerequisites
- Step-by-step procedure
- Common issues and solutions
- Best practices and tips

### 2. Structure as How-To
Organized into:
- Overview & prerequisites
- Numbered deployment steps
- Verification steps
- Troubleshooting section
- Related resources

### 3. Find Location
```
Notion:notion-search
query: "deployment documentation"
```
Found: Engineering Wiki → Deployment section

### 4. Create Guide
```
Notion:notion-create-pages
parent: { page_id: "deployment-section-id" }
```

## Output

```markdown
# How to Deploy to Production

## Overview
Production deployment using GitHub Actions with zero-downtime rolling updates.
**Time Required**: 15-20 minutes | **Complexity**: Intermediate

## Prerequisites
- [ ] PR approved and merged to main
- [ ] All CI tests passing
- [ ] Database migrations reviewed
- [ ] Feature flags configured

## Deployment Steps

1. **Verify main branch is ready**
   ```bash
   git checkout main && git pull
   ```

2. **Tag release**
   ```bash
   git tag -a v1.2.3 -m "Release v1.2.3"
   git push origin v1.2.3
   ```

3. **Trigger deployment**
   - GitHub Actions auto-starts from tag push
   - Monitor: https://github.com/org/repo/actions

4. **Database migrations** (if needed)
   - Auto-run in GitHub Actions
   - Check logs for completion

5. **Verify deployment**
   - Wait for health checks (2-3 min)
   - Test key endpoints
   - Check error rates in Datadog

## Verification Checklist
- [ ] All pods healthy in k8s dashboard
- [ ] Error rate < 0.1% in last 10 min
- [ ] Response time p95 < 500ms
- [ ] Test login flow
- [ ] Check Slack #alerts channel

## Troubleshooting

**Health checks failing**
→ Check pod logs: `kubectl logs -f deployment/api -n production`

**Migration errors**
→ Rollback: Revert tag, migrations auto-rollback

**High error rate**
→ Emergency rollback: Previous tag auto-deploys via GitHub Actions

## Best Practices
- Deploy during low-traffic hours (2-4am PST)
- Have 2 engineers available
- Monitor for 30 min post-deploy
- Update #engineering Slack with deploy notice

## Related Docs
- <mention-page url="...">Rollback Procedure</mention-page>
- <mention-page url="...">Database Migration Guide</mention-page>
```

### 5. Make Discoverable
```

page_id: "engineering-wiki-homepage"
command: "insert_content_after"
```
Added link in Engineering Wiki → How-To Guides section

## Key Success Factors
- Captured tribal knowledge from discussion
- Structured as actionable steps
- Included troubleshooting from experience
- Made discoverable by linking from wiki index
- Added metadata (time, complexity)

name: "openai-docs"
description: "Use when the user asks how to build with OpenAI products or APIs and needs up-to-date official documentation with citations (for example: Codex, Responses API, Chat Completions, Apps SDK, Agents SDK, Realtime, model capabilities or limits); prioritize OpenAI docs MCP tools and restrict any fallback browsing to official OpenAI domains."
---


# OpenAI Docs

Provide authoritative, current guidance from OpenAI developer docs using the developers.openai.com MCP server. Always prioritize the developer docs MCP tools over web.run for OpenAI-related questions. Only if the MCP server is installed and returns no meaningful results should you fall back to web search.

## Quick start

- Use `mcp__openaiDeveloperDocs__search_openai_docs` to find the most relevant doc pages.
- Use `mcp__openaiDeveloperDocs__fetch_openai_doc` to pull exact sections and quote/paraphrase accurately.
- Use `mcp__openaiDeveloperDocs__list_openai_docs` only when you need to browse or discover pages without a clear query.

## OpenAI product snapshots

1. Apps SDK: Build ChatGPT apps by providing a web component UI and an MCP server that exposes your app's tools to ChatGPT.
2. Responses API: A unified endpoint designed for stateful, multimodal, tool-using interactions in agentic workflows.
3. Chat Completions API: Generate a model response from a list of messages comprising a conversation.
4. Codex: OpenAI's coding agent for software development that can write, understand, review, and debug code.
5. gpt-oss: Open-weight OpenAI reasoning models (gpt-oss-120b and gpt-oss-20b) released under the Apache 2.0 license.
6. Realtime API: Build low-latency, multimodal experiences including natural speech-to-speech conversations.
7. Agents SDK: A toolkit for building agentic apps where a model can use tools and context, hand off to other agents, stream partial results, and keep a full trace.

## If MCP server is missing

If MCP tools fail or no OpenAI docs resources are available:

1. Run the install command yourself: `codex mcp add openaiDeveloperDocs --url https://developers.openai.com/mcp`
2. If it fails due to permissions/sandboxing, immediately retry the same command with escalated permissions and include a 1-sentence justification for approval. Do not ask the user to run it yet.
3. Only if the escalated attempt fails, ask the user to run the install command.
4. Ask the user to restart Codex.
5. Re-run the doc search/fetch after restart.

## Workflow

1. Clarify the product scope (Codex, OpenAI API, or ChatGPT Apps SDK) and the task.
2. Search docs with a precise query.
3. Fetch the best page and the specific section needed (use `anchor` when possible).
4. Answer with concise guidance and cite the doc source.
5. Provide code snippets only when the docs support them.

## Quality rules

- Treat OpenAI docs as the source of truth; avoid speculation.
- Keep quotes short and within policy limits; prefer paraphrase with citations.
- If multiple pages differ, call out the difference and cite both.
- If docs do not cover the user’s need, say so and offer next steps.

## Tooling notes

- Always use MCP doc tools before any web search for OpenAI-related questions.
- If the MCP server is installed but returns no meaningful results, then use web search as a fallback.
- When falling back to web search, restrict to official OpenAI domains (developers.openai.com, platform.openai.com) and cite sources.

# Render Configuration Guide

Common configuration patterns, best practices, and troubleshooting for Render deployments.

## Environment Variables

### Required vs Optional Variables

**Always declare ALL environment variables in render.yaml**, even if values are provided by user later.

**Three categories:**

1. **Configuration values** (hardcoded):
```yaml
envVars:
  - key: NODE_ENV
    value: production
  - key: LOG_LEVEL
    value: info
  - key: API_URL
    value: https://api.example.com
```

2. **Secrets** (user provides):
```yaml
envVars:
  - key: JWT_SECRET
    sync: false
  - key: STRIPE_SECRET_KEY
    sync: false
  - key: API_KEY
    sync: false
```

3. **Auto-generated** (Render provides):
```yaml
envVars:
  - key: SESSION_SECRET
    generateValue: true
  - key: ENCRYPTION_KEY
    generateValue: true
```

### Database Connection Patterns

**PostgreSQL:**
```yaml
envVars:
  - key: DATABASE_URL
    fromDatabase:
      name: postgres
      property: connectionString
```

**Redis:**
```yaml
envVars:
  - key: REDIS_URL
    fromDatabase:
      name: redis
      property: connectionString
```

**Multiple databases:**
```yaml
envVars:
  - key: PRIMARY_DB_URL
    fromDatabase:
      name: postgres-primary
      property: connectionString
  - key: ANALYTICS_DB_URL
    fromDatabase:
      name: postgres-analytics
      property: connectionString
  - key: CACHE_URL
    fromDatabase:
      name: redis
      property: connectionString
```

### Cross-Service References

Reference other services in your account:

```yaml
services:
  - type: web
    name: frontend
    runtime: node
    envVars:
      - key: API_URL
        fromService:
          name: backend-api
          type: web
          property: host  # or hostport, port

  - type: web
    name: backend-api
    runtime: node
```

**Available properties:**
- `host`: Service hostname
- `port`: Service port
- `hostport`: Combined `host:port`

### Environment Variable Groups

Share common configuration across services:

```yaml
envVarGroups:
  - name: common-config
    envVars:
      - key: NODE_ENV
        value: production
      - key: LOG_LEVEL
        value: info
      - key: TZ
        value: UTC

services:
  - type: web
    name: web-app
    runtime: node
    envVars:
      - fromGroup: common-config
      - key: PORT
        value: 10000

  - type: worker
    name: worker
    runtime: node
    envVars:
      - fromGroup: common-config
```

---

## Port Binding

### The Port Binding Requirement

**CRITICAL:** Web services must bind to `0.0.0.0:$PORT`

**Why this matters:**
- Render sets `PORT` environment variable (default: 10000)
- Services must bind to `0.0.0.0` (not `localhost` or `127.0.0.1`)
- Health checks fail if port binding is incorrect
- Deployment will fail or service won't receive traffic

### Code Examples by Language

**Node.js / Express:**
```javascript
const express = require('express');
const app = express();

const PORT = process.env.PORT || 3000;

app.listen(PORT, '0.0.0.0', () => {
  console.log(`Server running on port ${PORT}`);
});
```

**Python / Flask:**
```python
import os
from flask import Flask

app = Flask(__name__)

if __name__ == '__main__':
    port = int(os.environ.get('PORT', 5000))
    app.run(host='0.0.0.0', port=port)
```

**Python / Django:**

In `settings.py`:
```python
# Django runs on port specified by environment
ALLOWED_HOSTS = ['*']
```

Start command in render.yaml:
```yaml
startCommand: gunicorn config.wsgi:application --bind 0.0.0.0:$PORT
```

**Python / FastAPI:**
```python
import os
import uvicorn
from fastapi import FastAPI

app = FastAPI()

if __name__ == "__main__":
    port = int(os.environ.get("PORT", 8000))
    uvicorn.run(app, host="0.0.0.0", port=port)
```

Start command:
```yaml
startCommand: uvicorn main:app --host 0.0.0.0 --port $PORT
```

**Go:**
```go
package main

import (
    "fmt"
    "net/http"
    "os"
)

func main() {
    port := os.Getenv("PORT")
    if port == "" {
        port = "3000"
    }

    http.HandleFunc("/", handler)
    fmt.Printf("Server starting on port %s\n", port)
    http.ListenAndServe(":"+port, nil)
}
```

**Ruby / Rails:**

In `config/puma.rb`:
```ruby
port ENV.fetch("PORT") { 3000 }
bind "tcp://0.0.0.0:#{ENV.fetch('PORT', 3000)}"
```

**Rust / Actix:**
```rust
use actix_web::{App, HttpServer};
use std::env;

#[actix_web::main]
async fn main() -> std::io::Result<()> {
    let port = env::var("PORT").unwrap_or_else(|_| "8080".to_string());
    let addr = format!("0.0.0.0:{}", port);

    HttpServer::new(|| App::new())
        .bind(&addr)?
        .run()
        .await
}
```

## Build Commands

### Non-Interactive Flags

**Always use non-interactive flags** to prevent builds from hanging waiting for input.

**npm (Node.js):**
```yaml
buildCommand: npm ci
# NOT: npm install
```

**pip (Python):**
```yaml
buildCommand: pip install -r requirements.txt
# Already non-interactive
```

**apt (System packages):**
```yaml
buildCommand: apt-get update && apt-get install -y libpq-dev
# Use -y flag to auto-confirm
```

**bundler (Ruby):**
```yaml
buildCommand: bundle install --jobs=4 --retry=3
```

### Build with Additional Steps

**Node.js with build step:**
```yaml
buildCommand: npm ci && npm run build
```

**Python Django with static files:**
```yaml
buildCommand: pip install -r requirements.txt && python manage.py collectstatic --no-input
```

**Ruby Rails with assets:**
```yaml
buildCommand: bundle install && bundle exec rails assets:precompile
```

### Build Timeouts

**Free tier:** 15 minutes
**Paid tiers:** Configurable

**If builds timeout:**
1. Optimize dependencies (remove unused packages)
2. Use build caching
3. Consider pre-building in CI/CD
4. Upgrade to paid tier for longer timeouts

---

## Database Connections

### Internal vs External URLs

**Use internal URLs for better performance:**

When using `fromDatabase`, Render automatically provides internal `.render-internal.com` URLs:

```yaml
envVars:
  - key: DATABASE_URL
    fromDatabase:
      name: postgres
      property: connectionString
```

This provides: `postgresql://user:pass@postgres.render-internal.com:5432/db`

**Benefits:**
- Lower latency (same data center)
- No external bandwidth charges
- Automatic internal DNS

### Connection Pooling

**Node.js / PostgreSQL:**
```javascript
const { Pool } = require('pg');

const pool = new Pool({
  connectionString: process.env.DATABASE_URL,
  ssl: process.env.NODE_ENV === 'production' ? { rejectUnauthorized: false } : false,
  max: 20, // Maximum pool size
  idleTimeoutMillis: 30000,
  connectionTimeoutMillis: 2000,
});
```

**Python / PostgreSQL:**
```python
import psycopg2.pool

pool = psycopg2.pool.SimpleConnectionPool(
    minconn=1,
    maxconn=20,
    dsn=os.environ['DATABASE_URL']
)
```

**Django Settings:**
```python
DATABASES = {
    'default': {
        'ENGINE': 'django.db.backends.postgresql',
        'URL': os.environ['DATABASE_URL'],
        'CONN_MAX_AGE': 600,  # Connection pooling
    }
}
```

### Database Migrations

**Run migrations during build:**

**Django:**
```yaml
buildCommand: pip install -r requirements.txt && python manage.py migrate
```

**Rails:**
```yaml
buildCommand: bundle install && bundle exec rails db:migrate
```

**Node.js / Prisma:**
```yaml
buildCommand: npm ci && npx prisma migrate deploy
```

---

## Free Tier Limitations

### What's Included

**Free tier provides:**
- 1 web service
- 1 PostgreSQL database (1 GB storage, 97 MB RAM)
- 750 hours/month compute
- 512 MB RAM per service
- 0.5 CPU per service
- 100 GB bandwidth/month

### Resource Limits

**Memory (512 MB):**
- Monitor memory usage in logs
- Optimize for memory-constrained environments
- Use lightweight dependencies

**CPU (0.5 cores):**
- Suitable for low-traffic applications
- Consider upgrading for higher traffic

**Spin Down (Free services):**
- Services spin down after 15 minutes of inactivity
- First request after spin down takes ~30 seconds (cold start)
- Upgrade to paid tier for always-on services

### When to Upgrade

**Upgrade to paid plan when:**
- Need more than 1 web service
- Need always-on services (no spin down)
- Traffic exceeds free tier limits
- Need more memory/CPU
- Need faster build times
- Need preview environments

---

## Health Checks

### Adding Health Check Endpoints

**Node.js / Express:**
```javascript
app.get('/health', (req, res) => {
  res.status(200).json({
    status: 'ok',
    timestamp: new Date().toISOString()
  });
});
```

**Python / Flask:**
```python
@app.route('/health')
def health():
    return {'status': 'ok'}, 200
```

**Python / FastAPI:**
```python
@app.get("/health")
async def health():
    return {"status": "ok"}
```

**Go:**
```go
http.HandleFunc("/health", func(w http.ResponseWriter, r *http.Request) {
    w.WriteHeader(http.StatusOK)
    w.Write([]byte(`{"status":"ok"}`))
})
```

### Configure in render.yaml

```yaml
services:
  - type: web
    name: my-app
    runtime: node
    healthCheckPath: /health
```

**Benefits:**
- Faster deployment detection
- Better monitoring
- Automatic restart on health check failures

---

## Common Deployment Issues

### Issue 1: Missing Environment Variables

**Symptom:** Service crashes with "undefined variable" errors

**Solution:** Add all required env vars to render.yaml:
```yaml
envVars:
  - key: DATABASE_URL
    fromDatabase:
      name: postgres
      property: connectionString
  - key: JWT_SECRET
    sync: false  # User fills in Dashboard
```

### Issue 2: Port Binding Errors

**Symptom:** `EADDRINUSE` or health check timeout errors

**Solution:** Ensure app binds to `0.0.0.0:$PORT`:
```javascript
const PORT = process.env.PORT || 3000;
app.listen(PORT, '0.0.0.0');
```

### Issue 3: Build Hangs

**Symptom:** Build times out after 15 minutes

**Solution:** Use non-interactive build commands:
```yaml
buildCommand: npm ci  # NOT npm install
```

### Issue 4: Database Connection Fails

**Symptom:** `ECONNREFUSED` on port 5432

**Solutions:**
1. Use `fromDatabase` for automatic internal URLs
2. Enable SSL for external connections
3. Check `ipAllowList` settings

### Issue 5: Static Site 404s

**Symptom:** Client-side routes return 404

**Solution:** Add SPA rewrite rules:
```yaml
routes:
  - type: rewrite
    source: /*
    destination: /index.html
```

### Issue 6: Out of Memory (OOM)

**Symptom:** Service crashes with `JavaScript heap out of memory`

**Solutions:**
1. Optimize application memory usage
2. Reduce dependency size
3. Upgrade to higher plan with more RAM

---

}]
```

**Implementation Plan Created:**

```markdown
# Implementation Plan: User Profile API

## Overview
Build RESTful API for user profile management with CRUD operations, avatar upload, and search functionality.

## Linked Specification
<mention-page url="...">User Profile API Specification</mention-page>

## Requirements Summary

### Functional Requirements
- ✅ Get user profile (authenticated)
- ✅ Update profile fields (name, bio)
- ✅ Upload avatar with image processing
- ✅ Public profile view (limited fields)
- ✅ User search by name

### Non-Functional Requirements
- **Performance**: < 200ms response time (p95)
- **Scalability**: 1000 concurrent users
- **Storage**: Avatar files < 5MB to S3
- **Compliance**: GDPR data portability

### Acceptance Criteria
- All endpoints with proper status codes
- Input validation with error details
- JWT authentication required
- Rate limiting enforced
- Avatars stored in S3

## Technical Approach

### Architecture
- **Framework**: Express.js (Node.js)
- **Database**: PostgreSQL
- **Storage**: AWS S3 for avatars
- **Cache**: Redis for profile data
- **Search**: PostgreSQL full-text search

### Key Design Decisions
1. **JWT Authentication**: Stateless auth, scales horizontally
2. **S3 for Avatars**: Offload storage, CDN integration ready
3. **Redis Caching**: Reduce DB load for frequently accessed profiles
4. **Rate Limiting**: Token bucket algorithm, per-user limits

  content: "## Short Answer\n\nThe deployment port (usually 3000) is still occupied by a process from a previous deployment. You need to kill the existing process before deploying again.\n\n## Detailed Explanation\n\nWhen you deploy the application, it tries to bind to a specific port (e.g., port 3000). If a previous deployment didn't shut down cleanly, that process may still be running and holding the port. This prevents the new deployment from starting.\n\n**Common causes**:\n- Previous deployment crashed without cleanup\n- Manual `node` process started and forgotten\n- PM2 or other process manager didn't restart properly\n- Multiple deployments attempted simultaneously\n\n## Solution\n\n### Option 1: Kill the process using the port\n\n```bash\n# Find and kill process on port 3000\nlsof -ti:3000 | xargs kill -9\n```\n\nReplace `3000` with your application's port number.\n\n### Option 2: If using PM2\n\n```bash\n# Restart the application\npm2 restart app\n\n# Or delete and restart\npm2 delete app\npm2 start app.js --name app\n```\n\n### Option 3: Check all node processes\n\n```bash\n# List all node processes\nps aux | grep node\n\n# Kill specific process by PID\nkill -9 <PID>\n```\n\n## Prevention\n\n1. **Use process managers**: PM2, systemd, or Docker handle cleanup automatically\n2. **Graceful shutdown**: Implement proper shutdown handlers in your app\n3. **Health checks**: Monitor if previous deployment shut down before starting new one\n\n```javascript\n// Graceful shutdown example\nprocess.on('SIGTERM', () => {\n  server.close(() => {\n    console.log('Server closed');\n    process.exit(0);\n  });\n});\n```\n\n## Verification\n\nAfter killing the process, verify the port is free:\n\n```bash\nlsof -ti:3000\n# Should return nothing if port is free\n```\n\n## Related Questions\n- <mention-page url=\"...\">How do I check what's using a port?</mention-page>\n- <mention-page url=\"...\">How do I configure the application port?</mention-page>\n- <mention-page url=\"...\">PM2 deployment best practices</mention-page>\n\n## Last Updated\nOctober 14, 2025"

  content: "## Short Answer\n\n**Always check the logs first.** Logs contain error messages that point you directly to the problem. Use `pm2 logs`, `docker logs`, or check your application's log files.\n\n## Detailed Explanation\n\nLogs are your first and most important debugging tool. They show:\n- Exact error messages\n- Stack traces\n- Timing information\n- Configuration issues\n- Dependency problems\n\nMost deployment issues can be diagnosed and fixed by reading the logs carefully.\n\n## How to Check Logs\n\n### PM2\n\n```bash\n# View all logs\npm2 logs\n\n# View logs for specific app\npm2 logs app-name\n\n# View only errors\npm2 logs --err\n\n# Follow logs in real-time\npm2 logs --lines 100\n```\n\n### Docker\n\n```bash\n# View logs\ndocker logs container-name\n\n# Follow logs\ndocker logs -f container-name\n\n# Last 100 lines\ndocker logs --tail 100 container-name\n\n# With timestamps\ndocker logs -t container-name\n```\n\n### Application Logs\n\n```bash\n# Tail application logs\ntail -f /var/log/app/app.log\ntail -f /var/log/app/error.log\n\n# Search logs for errors\ngrep -i error /var/log/app/*.log\n\n# View logs with context\ngrep -B 5 -A 5 \"ERROR\" app.log\n```\n\n## Systematic Troubleshooting Approach\n\n### 1. Check the logs\n- Read error messages carefully\n- Note the exact error type and message\n- Check timestamps to find when error occurred\n\n### 2. Verify configuration\n- Environment variables set correctly?\n- Configuration files present and valid?\n- Paths and file permissions correct?\n\n### 3. Check dependencies\n- All packages installed? (`node_modules` present?)\n- Correct versions installed?\n- Any native module compilation errors?\n\n### 4. Verify environment\n- Required services running (database, Redis, etc.)?\n- Ports available?\n- Network connectivity working?\n\n### 5. Test components individually\n- Can you connect to database manually?\n- Can you run application locally?\n- Do health check endpoints work?\n\n### 6. Check recent changes\n- What changed since last successful deployment?\n- New dependencies added?\n- Configuration modified?\n- Environment differences?\n\n## Common Error Patterns\n\n### \"Module not found\"\n```bash\n# Solution: Install dependencies\nnpm install\n# or\nnpm ci\n```\n\n### \"Permission denied\"\n```bash\n# Solution: Fix file permissions\nchmod +x start.sh\nsudo chown -R appuser:appuser /app\n```\n\n### \"Address already in use\"\n```bash\n# Solution: Kill process on port\nlsof -ti:3000 | xargs kill -9\n```\n\n### \"Cannot connect to...\"\n```bash\n# Solution: Verify service is running and reachable\ntelnet service-host port\n```\n\n## Debugging Tools\n\n### Log Aggregation\n- **PM2**: Built-in log management\n- **Docker**: Centralized logging with log drivers\n- **ELK Stack**: Elasticsearch, Logstash, Kibana for large scale\n- **CloudWatch**: For AWS deployments\n\n### Monitoring\n- **PM2 Monit**: `pm2 monit` for real-time metrics\n- **Docker Stats**: `docker stats` for resource usage\n- **System metrics**: `top`, `htop` for CPU/memory\n\n### Network Debugging\n```bash\n# Check open connections\nnetstat -tulpn\n\n# Check specific port\nlsof -i :3000\n\n# Test connectivity\ncurl http://localhost:3000/health\n```\n\n## When to Escalate\n\nEscalate to senior team member if:\n- Error message is cryptic and not Google-able\n- Problem persists after trying obvious solutions\n- Production is affected\n- Data integrity may be compromised\n- Security-related errors\n\n## Prevention\n\n1. **Automated health checks** before deployment\n2. **Staged deployments** (dev → staging → production)\n3. **Rollback plan** ready for quick recovery\n4. **Monitoring and alerts** for early problem detection\n5. **Deployment checklist** to ensure all steps followed\n\n## Related Questions\n- <mention-page url=\"...\">How do I set up log aggregation?</mention-page>\n- <mention-page url=\"...\">Deployment checklist and best practices</mention-page>\n- <mention-page url=\"...\">How to roll back a failed deployment?</mention-page>\n\n## Last Updated\nOctober 14, 2025"

# Example: Decision Record Capture

**User Request**: "Document our decision to move from REST to GraphQL API"

## Workflow

### 1. Extract Decision from Context
From conversation, identified:
- **Decision**: Migrate customer-facing API from REST to GraphQL
- **Context**: REST endpoints becoming unwieldy (50+ endpoints)
- **Alternatives**: Keep REST, try gRPC, adopt GraphQL
- **Rationale**: Better client experience, type safety, single endpoint

### 2. Find Decision Log
```
Notion:notion-search
query: "architecture decisions" or "ADR"
```

Found: "Architecture Decision Records" database

### 3. Fetch Schema
```
Notion:notion-fetch
```

Got properties: Decision (title), Date, Status, Domain, Impact, Deciders, Stakeholders

### 4. Create Decision Record
```
Notion:notion-create-pages
parent: { data_source_id: "decision-log-collection-id" }
pages: [{
  properties: {
    "Decision": "Migrate to GraphQL API",
    "date:Date:start": "2025-10-16",
    "date:Date:is_datetime": 0,
    "Status": "Accepted",
    "Domain": "Architecture",
    "Impact": "High"
  },
  content: "[Full decision record with context, rationale, alternatives...]"
}]
```

**Content sample**:

```markdown
# Migrate Customer-Facing API to GraphQL

## Context
Our REST API has grown to 50+ endpoints with inconsistent patterns. Frontend and mobile teams request new endpoints frequently, leading to:
- API bloat and maintenance burden
- Over-fetching/under-fetching data
- Slow iteration on client features
- Inconsistent error handling

## Decision
Migrate customer-facing API from REST to GraphQL while maintaining REST for internal services.

## Rationale
**Why GraphQL**:
- Clients fetch exactly what they need (no over/under-fetching)
- Single endpoint, self-documenting schema
- Type safety with code generation
- Better developer experience
- Industry standard for client-facing APIs

## Options Considered

### Option A: Keep REST (Status Quo)
**Pros**: No migration cost, team familiar
**Cons**: Doesn't solve core problems, maintenance keeps growing
**Decision**: Rejected - doesn't address root cause

### Option B: gRPC
**Pros**: Performance, strong typing
**Cons**: Browser support issues, steeper learning curve, not designed for client-facing
**Decision**: Rejected - better for internal services

### Option C: GraphQL
**Pros**: Solves over/under-fetching, great DX, strong ecosystem
**Cons**: Learning curve, caching complexity, migration effort
**Decision**: **Accepted**

## Consequences

**Positive**:
- Faster frontend/mobile development
- Reduced API maintenance burden
- Better type safety and tooling
- Single endpoint simplifies deployment

**Negative**:
- 3-4 month migration timeline
- Team needs training
- Need to solve caching strategy
- Monitoring/debugging patterns different

## Implementation Plan
1. GraphQL server setup (Apollo Server)
2. Schema design workshop
3. Gradual migration (start with new features)
4. Dual-run period (both REST and GraphQL)
5. Deprecate old REST endpoints

**Timeline**: Start Q4 2025, complete Q1 2026
**Owner**: Backend team lead

## Success Metrics
- API response times improve 30%
- Client fetch efficiency (less data transferred)
- Reduced new endpoint requests
- Developer satisfaction scores
```

### 5. Make Discoverable
Added link from Architecture Wiki and notified team in Slack.

## Key Success Factors
- Captured decision while context fresh
- Documented alternatives considered
- Included both pros and cons
- Clear implementation plan
- Saved to decision log for future reference
- Made discoverable for team

# Architecture Decision: Database Migration Strategy

## Meeting Details
**Date & Time**: October 15, 2025 at 2:00 PM  
**Duration**: 90 minutes  
**Location**: Conference Room B / Zoom  
**Facilitator**: Sarah Chen (Engineering Lead)  
**Attendees**:

## Pre-Read Summary

### Background

Our MongoDB database is experiencing performance degradation as we scale. Query response times have increased from 50ms to 400ms average over the past 6 months. The schema-less nature that initially provided flexibility is now causing data consistency issues and making application logic more complex.

**Source**: <mention-page url="...">Current Database Performance Issues</mention-page>

### Current Situation

**Performance metrics**:
- Average query time: 400ms (was 50ms 6 months ago)
- p95 query time: 1.2s (was 200ms)
- Database size: 500GB (growing 20GB/month)
- Connection pool exhaustion during peak traffic

**Technical debt**:
- 15+ application-layer validation rules compensating for lack of schema
- Complex data migration scripts for schema changes
- Limited transaction support causing race conditions

**Source**: <mention-page url="...">Database Migration Proposal</mention-page>

### Historical Context

We successfully migrated from Redis to Memcached in 2023, which took 6 weeks. Key learnings:
- Underestimated application code changes (3 weeks instead of 1 week)
- Rollback plan was crucial when we discovered compatibility issues
- Parallel running period (dual writes) was essential for safe migration

**Source**: <mention-page url="...">Previous Migration Post-mortem</mention-page>

## Decision Required

**Question**: Which database migration strategy should we adopt?

**Timeline**: Need decision by end of week to include in Q4 planning

**Impact**: 
- Engineering team (4-8 weeks of work)
- Application architecture
- Operations & monitoring
- Future feature development velocity

# Cloudflare AI Gateway

Expert guidance for implementing Cloudflare AI Gateway - a universal gateway for AI model providers with analytics, caching, rate limiting, and routing capabilities.

## When to Use This Reference

- Setting up AI Gateway for any AI provider (OpenAI, Anthropic, Workers AI, etc.)
- Implementing caching, rate limiting, or request retry/fallback
- Configuring dynamic routing with A/B testing or model fallbacks
- Managing provider API keys securely with BYOK
- Adding security features (guardrails, DLP)
- Setting up observability with logging and custom metadata
- Debugging AI Gateway requests or optimizing configurations

## Quick Start

**What's your setup?**

- **Using Vercel AI SDK** → Pattern 1 (recommended) - see [sdk-integration.md](./sdk-integration.md)
- **Using OpenAI SDK** → Pattern 2 - see [sdk-integration.md](./sdk-integration.md)
- **Cloudflare Worker + Workers AI** → Pattern 3 - see [sdk-integration.md](./sdk-integration.md)
- **Direct HTTP (any language)** → Pattern 4 - see [configuration.md](./configuration.md)
- **Framework (LangChain, etc.)** → See [sdk-integration.md](./sdk-integration.md)

## Pattern 1: Vercel AI SDK (Recommended)

Most modern pattern using official `ai-gateway-provider` package with automatic fallbacks.

```typescript
import { createAiGateway } from 'ai-gateway-provider';
import { createOpenAI } from '@ai-sdk/openai';
import { generateText } from 'ai';

const gateway = createAiGateway({
  accountId: process.env.CF_ACCOUNT_ID,
  gateway: process.env.CF_GATEWAY_ID,
});

const openai = createOpenAI({ 
  apiKey: process.env.OPENAI_API_KEY 
});

// Single model
const { text } = await generateText({
  model: gateway(openai('gpt-4o')),
  prompt: 'Hello'
});

// Automatic fallback array
const { text } = await generateText({
  model: gateway([
    openai('gpt-4o'),              // Try first
    anthropic('claude-sonnet-4-5'), // Fallback
  ]),
  prompt: 'Hello'
});
```

**Install:** `npm install ai-gateway-provider ai @ai-sdk/openai @ai-sdk/anthropic`

## Pattern 2: OpenAI SDK

Drop-in replacement for OpenAI API with multi-provider support.

```typescript
import OpenAI from 'openai';

const client = new OpenAI({
  apiKey: process.env.OPENAI_API_KEY,
  baseURL: `https://gateway.ai.cloudflare.com/v1/${accountId}/${gatewayId}/compat`,
  defaultHeaders: {
    'cf-aig-authorization': `Bearer ${cfToken}` // For authenticated gateways
  }
});

// Switch providers by changing model format: {provider}/{model}
const response = await client.chat.completions.create({
  model: 'openai/gpt-4o', // or 'anthropic/claude-sonnet-4-5'
  messages: [{ role: 'user', content: 'Hello!' }]
});
```

## Pattern 3: Workers AI Binding

For Cloudflare Workers using Workers AI.

```typescript
export default {
  async fetch(request, env, ctx) {
    const response = await env.AI.run(
      '@cf/meta/llama-3-8b-instruct',
      { messages: [{ role: 'user', content: 'Hello!' }] },
      { 
        gateway: { 
          id: 'my-gateway',
          metadata: { userId: '123', team: 'engineering' }
        } 
      }
    );
    
    return Response.json(response);
  }
};
```

## Headers Quick Reference

## Architecture

AI Gateway acts as a proxy between your application and AI providers:

```
Your App → AI Gateway → AI Provider (OpenAI, Anthropic, etc.)
         ↓
    Analytics, Caching, Rate Limiting, Logging
```

**Key URL patterns:**
- Unified API (OpenAI-compatible): `https://gateway.ai.cloudflare.com/v1/{account_id}/{gateway_id}/compat/chat/completions`
- Provider-specific: `https://gateway.ai.cloudflare.com/v1/{account_id}/{gateway_id}/{provider}/{endpoint}`
- Dynamic routes: Use route name instead of model: `dynamic/{route-name}`

## Gateway Types

1. **Unauthenticated Gateway**: Open access (not recommended for production)
2. **Authenticated Gateway**: Requires `cf-aig-authorization` header with Cloudflare API token (recommended)

## Provider Authentication Options

1. **Unified Billing**: Use AI Gateway billing to pay for inference (keyless mode - no provider API key needed)
2. **BYOK (Store Keys)**: Store provider API keys in Cloudflare dashboard
3. **Request Headers**: Include provider API key in each request

# Cloudflare AI Search Reference

Expert guidance for implementing Cloudflare AI Search (formerly AutoRAG), Cloudflare's managed semantic search and RAG service.

## Overview

**AI Search** is a managed RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) pipeline that combines:
- Automatic semantic indexing of your content
- Vector similarity search
- Built-in LLM generation

**Key value propositions:**
- **Zero vector management** - No manual embedding, indexing, or storage
- **Auto-indexing** - Content automatically re-indexed every 6 hours
- **Built-in generation** - Optional AI response generation from retrieved context
- **Multi-source** - Index from R2 buckets or website crawls

**Data source options:**
- **R2 bucket** - Index files from Cloudflare R2 (supports MD, TXT, HTML, PDF, DOC, CSV, JSON)
- **Website** - Crawl and index website content (requires Cloudflare-hosted domain)

**Indexing lifecycle:**
- Automatic 6-hour refresh cycle
- Manual "Force Sync" available (30s rate limit)
- Not designed for real-time updates

## Quick Start

**1. Create AI Search instance in dashboard:**
- Go to Cloudflare Dashboard → AI Search → Create
- Choose data source (R2 or website)
- Configure instance name and settings

**2. Configure Worker:**

```jsonc
// wrangler.jsonc
{
  "ai": {
    "binding": "AI"
  }
}
```

**3. Use in Worker:**

```typescript
export default {
  async fetch(request, env) {
    const answer = await env.AI.autorag("my-search-instance").aiSearch({
      query: "How do I configure caching?",
      model: "@cf/meta/llama-3.3-70b-instruct-fp8-fast"
    });
    
    return Response.json({ answer: answer.response });
  }
};
```

## When to Use AI Search

### AI Search vs Vectorize

| Factor | AI Search | Vectorize |
|--------|-----------|-----------|
| **Management** | Fully managed | Manual embedding + indexing |
| **Use when** | Want zero-ops RAG pipeline | Need custom embeddings/control |
| **Indexing** | Automatic (6hr cycle) | Manual via API |
| **Generation** | Built-in optional | Bring your own LLM |
| **Data sources** | R2 or website | Manual insert |
| **Best for** | Docs, support, enterprise search | Custom ML pipelines, real-time |

### AI Search vs Direct Workers AI

| Factor | AI Search | Workers AI (direct) |
|--------|-----------|---------------------|
| **Context** | Automatic retrieval | Manual context building |
| **Use when** | Need RAG (search + generate) | Simple generation tasks |
| **Indexing** | Built-in | Not applicable |
| **Best for** | Knowledge bases, docs | Simple chat, transformations |

### search() vs aiSearch()

| Method | Returns | Use When |
|--------|---------|----------|
| `search()` | Search results only | Building custom UI, need raw chunks |
| `aiSearch()` | AI response + results | Need ready-to-use answer (chatbot, Q&A) |

### Real-time Updates Consideration

**AI Search is NOT ideal if:**
- Need real-time content updates (<6 hours)
- Content changes multiple times per hour
- Strict freshness requirements

**AI Search IS ideal if:**
- Content relatively stable (docs, policies, knowledge bases)
- 6-hour refresh acceptable
- Prefer zero-ops over real-time

## Platform Limits

| Limit | Value |
|-------|-------|
| Max instances per account | 10 |
| Max files per instance | 100,000 |
| Max file size | 4 MB |
| Index frequency | Every 6 hours |
| Force Sync rate limit | Once per 30 seconds |
| Filter nesting depth | 2 levels |
| Filters per compound | 10 |
| Score threshold range | 0.0 - 1.0 |

# Cloudflare Workers Analytics Engine Reference

Expert guidance for implementing unlimited-cardinality analytics at scale using Cloudflare Workers Analytics Engine.

## What is Analytics Engine?

Time-series analytics database designed for high-cardinality data (millions of unique dimensions). Write data points from Workers, query via SQL API. Use for:
- Custom user-facing analytics dashboards
- Usage-based billing & metering
- Per-customer/per-feature monitoring
- High-frequency instrumentation without performance impact

**Key Capability:** Track metrics with unlimited unique values (e.g., millions of user IDs, API keys) without performance degradation.

## Core Concepts

| Concept | Description | Example |
|---------|-------------|---------|
| **Dataset** | Logical table for related metrics | `api_requests`, `user_events` |
| **Data Point** | Single measurement with timestamp | One API request's metrics |
| **Blobs** | String dimensions (max 20) | endpoint, method, status, user_id |
| **Doubles** | Numeric values (max 20) | latency_ms, request_count, bytes |
| **Indexes** | Filtered blobs for efficient queries | customer_id, api_key |

## Reading Order

| Task | Start Here | Then Read |
|------|------------|-----------|
| **First-time setup** | [configuration.md](configuration.md) → [api.md](api.md) → [patterns.md](patterns.md) | |
| **Writing data** | [api.md](api.md) → [gotchas.md](gotchas.md) (sampling) | |
| **Querying data** | [api.md](api.md) (SQL API) → [patterns.md](patterns.md) (examples) | |
| **Debugging** | [gotchas.md](gotchas.md) → [api.md](api.md) (limits) | |
| **Optimization** | [patterns.md](patterns.md) (anti-patterns) → [gotchas.md](gotchas.md) | |

## When to Use Analytics Engine

```
Need to track metrics? → Yes
  ↓
Millions of unique dimension values? → Yes
    ↓
  Need real-time queries? → Yes
      ↓
    Use Analytics Engine ✓

Alternative scenarios:
- Low cardinality (<10k unique values) → Workers Analytics (free tier)
- Complex joins/relations → D1 Database
- Logs/debugging → Tail Workers (logpush)
- External tools → Send to external analytics (Datadog, etc.)
```

## Quick Start

1. Add binding to `wrangler.jsonc`:
```jsonc
{
  "analytics_engine_datasets": [
    { "binding": "ANALYTICS", "dataset": "my_events" }
  ]
}
```

2. Write data points (fire-and-forget, no await):
```typescript
env.ANALYTICS.writeDataPoint({
  blobs: ["/api/users", "GET", "200"],
  doubles: [145.2, 1],  // latency_ms, count
  indexes: [customerId]
});
```

3. Query via SQL API (HTTP):
```sql
SELECT blob1, SUM(double2) AS total_requests
FROM my_events
WHERE index1 = 'customer_123'
  AND timestamp >= NOW() - INTERVAL '7' DAY
GROUP BY blob1
ORDER BY total_requests DESC
```

# Cloudflare API Integration

Guide for working with Cloudflare's REST API - authentication, SDK usage, common patterns, and troubleshooting.

## Quick Decision Tree

```
How are you calling the Cloudflare API?
├─ From Workers runtime → Use bindings, not REST API (see ../bindings/)
├─ Server-side (Node/Python/Go) → Official SDK (see api.md)
├─ CLI/scripts → Wrangler or curl (see configuration.md)
├─ Infrastructure-as-code → See ../pulumi/ or ../terraform/
└─ One-off requests → curl examples (see api.md)
```

## SDK Selection

| Language | Package | Best For | Default Retries |
|----------|---------|----------|-----------------|
| TypeScript | `cloudflare` | Node.js, Bun, Next.js, Workers | 2 |
| Python | `cloudflare` | FastAPI, Django, scripts | 2 |
| Go | `cloudflare-go/v4` | CLI tools, microservices | 10 |

All SDKs are Stainless-generated from OpenAPI spec (consistent APIs).

## Authentication Methods

| Method | Security | Use Case | Scope |
|--------|----------|----------|-------|
| **API Token** ✓ | Scoped, rotatable | Production | Per-zone or account |
| API Key + Email | Full account access | Legacy only | Everything |
| User Service Key | Limited | Origin CA certs only | Origin CA |

**Always use API tokens** for new projects.

## Rate Limits

| Limit | Value |
|-------|-------|
| Per user/token | 1200 requests / 5 minutes |
| Per IP | 200 requests / second |
| GraphQL | 320 / 5 minutes (cost-based) |

# Cloudflare Argo Smart Routing Skill Reference

## Overview

Cloudflare Argo Smart Routing is a performance optimization service that detects real-time network issues and routes web traffic across the most efficient network path. It continuously monitors network conditions and intelligently routes traffic through the fastest, most reliable routes in Cloudflare's network.

**Note on Smart Shield:** Argo Smart Routing is being integrated into Cloudflare's Smart Shield product for enhanced DDoS protection and performance. Existing Argo customers maintain full functionality with gradual migration to Smart Shield features.

## Quick Start

### Enable via cURL
```bash
curl -X PATCH "https://api.cloudflare.com/client/v4/zones/{zone_id}/argo/smart_routing" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_API_TOKEN" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"value": "on"}'
```

### Enable via TypeScript SDK
```typescript
import Cloudflare from 'cloudflare';

const client = new Cloudflare({ apiToken: process.env.CLOUDFLARE_API_TOKEN });

const result = await client.argo.smartRouting.edit({
  zone_id: 'your-zone-id',
  value: 'on',
});

console.log(`Argo enabled: ${result.value}`);
```

## Core Concepts

### What It Does
- **Intelligent routing**: Detects congestion, outages, packet loss in real-time
- **Global optimization**: Routes across 300+ Cloudflare data centers
- **Automatic failover**: Switches paths when issues detected (typically <1s)
- **Works with existing setup**: No origin changes required

### Billing Model
- Usage-based: Charged per GB of traffic (excluding DDoS/WAF mitigated traffic)
- Requires billing configuration before enabling
- Available on Enterprise+ plans (check zone eligibility)

### When to Use
- **High-traffic production sites** with global user base
- **Latency-sensitive applications** (APIs, real-time services)
- **Sites behind Cloudflare proxy** (orange-clouded DNS records)
- **Combined with Tiered Cache** for maximum performance gains

### When NOT to Use
- Development/staging environments (cost control)
- Low-traffic sites (<1TB/month) where cost may exceed benefit
- Sites with primarily single-region traffic

## Should I Enable Argo?

| Your Situation | Recommendation |
|----------------|----------------|
| Global production app, >1TB/month traffic | ✅ Enable - likely ROI positive |
| Enterprise plan, latency-critical APIs | ✅ Enable - performance matters |
| Regional site, <100GB/month traffic | ⚠️ Evaluate - cost may not justify |
| Development/staging environment | ❌ Disable - use in production only |
| Not yet configured billing | ❌ Configure billing first |

| **Browser Rendering** | Headless Chrome | `env.BROWSER.fetch(url)` |

### Platform Bindings

| Binding | Use Case | Access Pattern |
|---------|----------|----------------|
| **Analytics Engine** | Custom metrics | `env.ANALYTICS.writeDataPoint(data)` |
| **mTLS** | Client certificates | `env.MY_CERT` (string) |
| **Hyperdrive** | Database pooling | `env.HYPERDRIVE.connectionString` |
| **Rate Limiting** | Request throttling | `env.RATE_LIMITER.limit(id)` |
| **Workflows** | Long-running workflows | `env.MY_WORKFLOW.create()` |

### Configuration Bindings

| Binding | Use Case | Access Pattern |
|---------|----------|----------------|
| **Environment Variables** | Non-sensitive config | `env.API_URL` (string) |
| **Secrets** | Sensitive values | `env.API_KEY` (string) |
| **Text/Data Blobs** | Static files | `env.MY_BLOB` (string) |
| **WASM** | WebAssembly modules | `env.MY_WASM` (WebAssembly.Module) |

## Quick Selection Guide

**Need persistent storage?**
- Key-value < 25MB → **KV**
- Files/objects → **R2**
- Relational data → **D1**
- Real-time coordination → **Durable Objects**

**Need AI/compute?**
- LLM inference → **Workers AI**
- Scraping/PDFs → **Browser Rendering**
- Call another Worker → **Service binding**

**Need async processing?**
- Background jobs → **Queues**

**Need config?**
- Public values → **Environment Variables**
- Secrets → **Secrets** (never commit)

## Quick Start

1. **Add binding to wrangler.jsonc:**
```jsonc
{
  "kv_namespaces": [
    { "binding": "MY_KV", "id": "your-kv-id" }
  ]
}
```

2. **Generate types:**
```bash
npx wrangler types
```

3. **Access in Worker:**
```typescript
export default {
  async fetch(request, env, ctx) {
    await env.MY_KV.put('key', 'value');
    return new Response('OK');
  }
}
```

## Type Safety

Bindings are fully typed via `wrangler types`. See [api.md](api.md) for details.

## Limits

- 64 bindings max per Worker (all types combined)
- See [gotchas.md](gotchas.md) for per-binding limits

## Key Concepts

**Zero-overhead access:** Bindings compiled into Worker, no network calls to access
**Type-safe:** Full TypeScript support via `wrangler types`
**Per-environment:** Different IDs for dev/staging/production
**Secrets vs Vars:** Secrets encrypted at rest, never in config files

# Cloudflare Bot Management

Enterprise-grade bot detection, protection, and mitigation using ML/heuristics, bot scores, JavaScript detections, and verified bot handling.

## Overview

Bot Management provides multi-tier protection:
- **Free (Bot Fight Mode)**: Auto-blocks definite bots, no config
- **Pro/Business (Super Bot Fight Mode)**: Configurable actions, static resource protection, analytics groupings
- **Enterprise (Bot Management)**: Granular 1-99 scores, WAF integration, JA3/JA4 fingerprinting, Workers API, Advanced Analytics

## Quick Start

```txt
# Dashboard: Security > Bots
# Enterprise: Deploy rule template
(cf.bot_management.score eq 1 and not cf.bot_management.verified_bot) → Block
(cf.bot_management.score le 29 and not cf.bot_management.verified_bot) → Managed Challenge
```

## What Do You Need?

```txt
├─ Initial setup → configuration.md
│   ├─ Free tier → "Bot Fight Mode"
│   ├─ Pro/Business → "Super Bot Fight Mode"
│   └─ Enterprise → "Bot Management for Enterprise"
├─ Workers API integration → api.md
├─ WAF rules → patterns.md
├─ Debugging → gotchas.md
└─ Analytics → api.md#bot-analytics
```

## Reading Order

| Task | Files to Read |
|------|---------------|
| Enable bot protection | README → configuration.md |
| Workers bot detection | README → api.md |
| WAF rule templates | README → patterns.md |
| Debug bot issues | gotchas.md |
| Advanced analytics | api.md#bot-analytics |

## Core Concepts

**Bot Scores**: 1-99 (1 = definitely automated, 99 = definitely human). Threshold: <30 indicates bot traffic. Enterprise gets granular 1-99; Pro/Business get groupings only.

**Detection Engines**: Heuristics (known fingerprints, assigns score=1), ML (majority of detections, supervised learning on billions of requests), Anomaly Detection (optional, baseline traffic analysis), JavaScript Detections (headless browser detection).

**Verified Bots**: Allowlisted good bots (search engines, AI crawlers) verified via reverse DNS or Web Bot Auth. Access via `cf.bot_management.verified_bot` or `cf.verified_bot_category`.

## Platform Limits

| Plan | Bot Scores | JA3/JA4 | Custom Rules | Analytics Retention |
|------|------------|---------|--------------|---------------------|
| Free | No (auto-block only) | No | 5 | N/A (no analytics) |
| Pro/Business | Groupings only | No | 20/100 | 30 days (72h at a time) |
| Enterprise | 1-99 granular | Yes | 1,000+ | 30 days (1 week at a time) |

## Basic Patterns

```typescript
// Workers: Check bot score
export default {
  async fetch(request: Request): Promise<Response> {
    const botScore = request.cf?.botManagement?.score;
    if (botScore && botScore < 30 && !request.cf?.botManagement?.verifiedBot) {
      return new Response('Bot detected', { status: 403 });
    }
    return fetch(request);
  }
};
```

```txt
# WAF: Block definite bots
(cf.bot_management.score eq 1 and not cf.bot_management.verified_bot)

# WAF: Protect sensitive endpoints
(cf.bot_management.score lt 50 and http.request.uri.path in {"/login" "/checkout"} and not cf.bot_management.verified_bot)
```

# Cloudflare Browser Rendering Skill Reference

**Description**: Expert knowledge for Cloudflare Browser Rendering - control headless Chrome on Cloudflare's global network for browser automation, screenshots, PDFs, web scraping, testing, and content generation.

**When to use**: Any task involving Cloudflare Browser Rendering including: taking screenshots, generating PDFs, web scraping, browser automation, testing web applications, extracting structured data, capturing page metrics, or automating browser interactions.

## Decision Tree

### REST API vs Workers Bindings

**Use REST API when:**
- One-off, stateless tasks (screenshot, PDF, content fetch)
- No Workers infrastructure yet
- Simple integrations from external services
- Need quick prototyping without deployment

**Use Workers Bindings when:**
- Complex browser automation workflows
- Need session reuse for performance
- Multiple page interactions per request
- Custom scripting and logic required
- Building production applications

### Puppeteer vs Playwright

| Feature | Puppeteer | Playwright |
|---------|-----------|------------|
| API Style | Chrome DevTools Protocol | High-level abstractions |
| Selectors | CSS, XPath | CSS, text, role, test-id |
| Best for | Advanced control, CDP access | Quick automation, testing |
| Learning curve | Steeper | Gentler |

**Use Puppeteer:** Need CDP protocol access, Chrome-specific features, migration from existing Puppeteer code
**Use Playwright:** Modern selector APIs, cross-browser patterns, faster development

## Tier Limits Summary

| Limit | Free Tier | Paid Tier |
|-------|-----------|-----------|
| Daily browser time | 10 minutes | Unlimited* |
| Concurrent sessions | 3 | 30 |
| Requests per minute | 6 | 180 |

*Subject to fair-use policy. See [gotchas.md](gotchas.md) for details.

description: "Translate Figma nodes into production-ready code with 1:1 visual fidelity using the Figma MCP workflow (design context, screenshots, assets, and project-convention translation). Trigger when the user provides Figma URLs or node IDs, or asks to implement designs or components that must match Figma specs. Requires a working Figma MCP server connection."
---


# Implement Design

## Overview

This skill provides a structured workflow for translating Figma designs into production-ready code with pixel-perfect accuracy. It ensures consistent integration with the Figma MCP server, proper use of design tokens, and 1:1 visual parity with designs.

## Prerequisites

- Figma MCP server must be connected and accessible
- User must provide a Figma URL in the format: `https://figma.com/design/:fileKey/:fileName?node-id=1-2`
  - `:fileKey` is the file key
  - `1-2` is the node ID (the specific component or frame to implement)
- **OR** when using `figma-desktop` MCP: User can select a node directly in the Figma desktop app (no URL required)
- Project should have an established design system or component library (preferred)

## Required Workflow

**Follow these steps in order. Do not skip steps.**

### Step 0: Set up Figma MCP (if not already configured)

If any MCP call fails because Figma MCP is not connected, pause and set it up:

1. Add the Figma MCP:
   - `codex mcp add figma --url https://mcp.figma.com/mcp`
2. Enable remote MCP client:
   - Set `[features].rmcp_client = true` in `config.toml` **or** run `codex --enable rmcp_client`
3. Log in with OAuth:
   - `codex mcp login figma`

After successful login, the user will have to restart codex. You should finish your answer and tell them so when they try again they can continue with Step 1.

### Step 1: Get Node ID

#### Option A: Parse from Figma URL

When the user provides a Figma URL, extract the file key and node ID to pass as arguments to MCP tools.

**URL format:** `https://figma.com/design/:fileKey/:fileName?node-id=1-2`

**Extract:**

- **File key:** `:fileKey` (the segment after `/design/`)
- **Node ID:** `1-2` (the value of the `node-id` query parameter)

**Note:** When using the local desktop MCP (`figma-desktop`), `fileKey` is not passed as a parameter to tool calls. The server automatically uses the currently open file, so only `nodeId` is needed.

**Example:**

- URL: `https://figma.com/design/kL9xQn2VwM8pYrTb4ZcHjF/DesignSystem?node-id=42-15`
- File key: `kL9xQn2VwM8pYrTb4ZcHjF`
- Node ID: `42-15`

#### Option B: Use Current Selection from Figma Desktop App (figma-desktop MCP only)

When using the `figma-desktop` MCP and the user has NOT provided a URL, the tools automatically use the currently selected node from the open Figma file in the desktop app.

**Note:** Selection-based prompting only works with the `figma-desktop` MCP server. The remote server requires a link to a frame or layer to extract context. The user must have the Figma desktop app open with a node selected.

### Step 2: Fetch Design Context

Run `get_design_context` with the extracted file key and node ID.

```
get_design_context(fileKey=":fileKey", nodeId="1-2")
```

This provides the structured data including:

- Layout properties (Auto Layout, constraints, sizing)
- Typography specifications
- Color values and design tokens
- Component structure and variants
- Spacing and padding values

**If the response is too large or truncated:**

1. Run `get_metadata(fileKey=":fileKey", nodeId="1-2")` to get the high-level node map
2. Identify the specific child nodes needed from the metadata
3. Fetch individual child nodes with `get_design_context(fileKey=":fileKey", nodeId=":childNodeId")`

### Step 3: Capture Visual Reference

Run `get_screenshot` with the same file key and node ID for a visual reference.

```
get_screenshot(fileKey=":fileKey", nodeId="1-2")
```

This screenshot serves as the source of truth for visual validation. Keep it accessible throughout implementation.

### Step 4: Download Required Assets

Download any assets (images, icons, SVGs) returned by the Figma MCP server.

**IMPORTANT:** Follow these asset rules:

- If the Figma MCP server returns a `localhost` source for an image or SVG, use that source directly
- DO NOT import or add new icon packages - all assets should come from the Figma payload
- DO NOT use or create placeholders if a `localhost` source is provided
- Assets are served through the Figma MCP server's built-in assets endpoint

### Step 5: Translate to Project Conventions

Translate the Figma output into this project's framework, styles, and conventions.

**Key principles:**

- Treat the Figma MCP output (typically React + Tailwind) as a representation of design and behavior, not as final code style
- Replace Tailwind utility classes with the project's preferred utilities or design system tokens
- Reuse existing components (buttons, inputs, typography, icon wrappers) instead of duplicating functionality
- Use the project's color system, typography scale, and spacing tokens consistently
- Respect existing routing, state management, and data-fetch patterns

### Step 6: Achieve 1:1 Visual Parity

Strive for pixel-perfect visual parity with the Figma design.

**Guidelines:**

- Prioritize Figma fidelity to match designs exactly
- Avoid hardcoded values - use design tokens from Figma where available
- When conflicts arise between design system tokens and Figma specs, prefer design system tokens but adjust spacing or sizes minimally to match visuals
- Follow WCAG requirements for accessibility
- Add component documentation as needed

### Step 7: Validate Against Figma

Before marking complete, validate the final UI against the Figma screenshot.

**Validation checklist:**

- [ ] Layout matches (spacing, alignment, sizing)
- [ ] Typography matches (font, size, weight, line height)
- [ ] Colors match exactly
- [ ] Interactive states work as designed (hover, active, disabled)
- [ ] Responsive behavior follows Figma constraints
- [ ] Assets render correctly
- [ ] Accessibility standards met

## Implementation Rules

### Component Organization

- Place UI components in the project's designated design system directory
- Follow the project's component naming conventions
- Avoid inline styles unless truly necessary for dynamic values

### Design System Integration

- ALWAYS use components from the project's design system when possible
- Map Figma design tokens to project design tokens
- When a matching component exists, extend it rather than creating a new one
- Document any new components added to the design system

### Code Quality

- Avoid hardcoded values - extract to constants or design tokens
- Keep components composable and reusable
- Add TypeScript types for component props
- Include JSDoc comments for exported components

## Examples

### Example 1: Implementing a Button Component

User says: "Implement this Figma button component: https://figma.com/design/kL9xQn2VwM8pYrTb4ZcHjF/DesignSystem?node-id=42-15"

**Actions:**

1. Parse URL to extract fileKey=`kL9xQn2VwM8pYrTb4ZcHjF` and nodeId=`42-15`
2. Run `get_design_context(fileKey="kL9xQn2VwM8pYrTb4ZcHjF", nodeId="42-15")`
3. Run `get_screenshot(fileKey="kL9xQn2VwM8pYrTb4ZcHjF", nodeId="42-15")` for visual reference
4. Download any button icons from the assets endpoint
5. Check if project has existing button component
6. If yes, extend it with new variant; if no, create new component using project conventions
7. Map Figma colors to project design tokens (e.g., `primary-500`, `primary-hover`)
8. Validate against screenshot for padding, border radius, typography

**Result:** Button component matching Figma design, integrated with project design system.

### Example 2: Building a Dashboard Layout

User says: "Build this dashboard: https://figma.com/design/pR8mNv5KqXzGwY2JtCfL4D/Dashboard?node-id=10-5"

**Actions:**

1. Parse URL to extract fileKey=`pR8mNv5KqXzGwY2JtCfL4D` and nodeId=`10-5`
2. Run `get_metadata(fileKey="pR8mNv5KqXzGwY2JtCfL4D", nodeId="10-5")` to understand the page structure
3. Identify main sections from metadata (header, sidebar, content area, cards) and their child node IDs
4. Run `get_design_context(fileKey="pR8mNv5KqXzGwY2JtCfL4D", nodeId=":childNodeId")` for each major section
5. Run `get_screenshot(fileKey="pR8mNv5KqXzGwY2JtCfL4D", nodeId="10-5")` for the full page
6. Download all assets (logos, icons, charts)
7. Build layout using project's layout primitives
8. Implement each section using existing components where possible
9. Validate responsive behavior against Figma constraints

**Result:** Complete dashboard matching Figma design with responsive layout.

## Best Practices

### Always Start with Context

Never implement based on assumptions. Always fetch `get_design_context` and `get_screenshot` first.

### Incremental Validation

Validate frequently during implementation, not just at the end. This catches issues early.

### Document Deviations

If you must deviate from the Figma design (e.g., for accessibility or technical constraints), document why in code comments.

### Reuse Over Recreation

Always check for existing components before creating new ones. Consistency across the codebase is more important than exact Figma replication.

### Design System First

When in doubt, prefer the project's design system patterns over literal Figma translation.

## Common Issues and Solutions

### Issue: Figma output is truncated

**Cause:** The design is too complex or has too many nested layers to return in a single response.
**Solution:** Use `get_metadata` to get the node structure, then fetch specific nodes individually with `get_design_context`.

### Issue: Design doesn't match after implementation

**Cause:** Visual discrepancies between the implemented code and the original Figma design.
**Solution:** Compare side-by-side with the screenshot from Step 3. Check spacing, colors, and typography values in the design context data.

### Issue: Assets not loading

**Cause:** The Figma MCP server's assets endpoint is not accessible or the URLs are being modified.
**Solution:** Verify the Figma MCP server's assets endpoint is accessible. The server serves assets at `localhost` URLs. Use these directly without modification.

### Issue: Design token values differ from Figma

**Cause:** The project's design system tokens have different values than those specified in the Figma design.
**Solution:** When project tokens differ from Figma values, prefer project tokens for consistency but adjust spacing/sizing to maintain visual fidelity.

## Understanding Design Implementation

The Figma implementation workflow establishes a reliable process for translating designs to code:

**For designers:** Confidence that implementations will match their designs with pixel-perfect accuracy.
**For developers:** A structured approach that eliminates guesswork and reduces back-and-forth revisions.
**For teams:** Consistent, high-quality implementations that maintain design system integrity.

By following this workflow, you ensure that every Figma design is implemented with the same level of care and attention to detail.

       distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must
       include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained
       within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not
       pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one
       of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed

       documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,

   agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each
   Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS,
   WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or
   implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions
   of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A

   liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
   incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a

   WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or
   implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions
   of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A

   negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
   liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,

## Installing a skill

Skills in [`.system`](skills/.system/) are automatically installed in the latest version of Codex.

To install [curated](skills/.curated/) or [experimental](skills/.experimental/) skills, you can use the `$skill-installer` inside Codex.

Curated skills can be installed by name (defaults to `skills/.curated`):

```
$skill-installer gh-address-comments
```

For experimental skills, specify the skill folder. For example:

```
$skill-installer install the create-plan skill from the .experimental folder
```

Or provide the GitHub directory URL:

```
$skill-installer install https://github.com/openai/skills/tree/main/skills/.experimental/create-plan
```

After installing a skill, restart Codex to pick up new skills.

## Troubleshooting

### Escalated Network Access

If deployment fails due to network issues (timeouts, DNS errors, connection resets), rerun the deploy with escalated permissions (use `sandbox_permissions=require_escalated`). The deploy requires escalated network access when sandbox networking blocks outbound requests.

Example guidance to the user:

```
The deploy needs escalated network access to deploy to Cloudflare. I can rerun the command with escalated permissions—want me to proceed?
```


--- skills/.curated/develop-web-game/SKILL.md ---
---
name: "develop-web-game"
description: "Use when Codex is building or iterating on a web game (HTML/JS) and needs a reliable development + testing loop: implement small changes, run a Playwright-based test script with short input bursts and intentional pauses, inspect screenshots/text, and review console errors with render_game_to_text."
---


# Develop Web Game

Build games in small steps and validate every change. Treat each iteration as: implement → act → pause → observe → adjust.

## Skill paths (set once)

```bash
export CODEX_HOME="${CODEX_HOME:-$HOME/.codex}"
export WEB_GAME_CLIENT="$CODEX_HOME/skills/develop-web-game/scripts/web_game_playwright_client.js"
export WEB_GAME_ACTIONS="$CODEX_HOME/skills/develop-web-game/references/action_payloads.json"
```

User-scoped skills install under `$CODEX_HOME/skills` (default: `~/.codex/skills`).

## Workflow

1. **Pick a goal.** Define a single feature or behavior to implement.
2. **Implement small.** Make the smallest change that moves the game forward.
3. **Ensure integration points.** Provide a single canvas and `window.render_game_to_text` so the test loop can read state.
4. **Add `window.advanceTime(ms)`.** Strongly prefer a deterministic step hook so the Playwright script can advance frames reliably; without it, automated tests can be flaky.
5. **Initialize progress.md.** If `progress.md` exists, read it first and confirm the original user prompt is recorded at the top (prefix with `Original prompt:`). Also note any TODOs and suggestions left by the previous agent. If missing, create it and write `Original prompt: <prompt>` at the top before appending updates.
6. **Verify Playwright availability.** Ensure `playwright` is available (local dependency or global install). If unsure, check `npx` first.
7. **Run the Playwright test script.** You must run `$WEB_GAME_CLIENT` after each meaningful change; do not invent a new client unless required.
8. **Use the payload reference.** Base actions on `$WEB_GAME_ACTIONS` to avoid guessing keys.
9. **Inspect state.** Capture screenshots and text state after each burst.
10. **Inspect screenshots.** Open the latest screenshot, verify expected visuals, fix any issues, and rerun the script. Repeat until correct.
11. **Verify controls and state (multi-step focus).** Exhaustively exercise all important interactions. For each, think through the full multi-step sequence it implies (cause → intermediate states → outcome) and verify the entire chain works end-to-end. Confirm `render_game_to_text` reflects the same state shown on screen. If anything is off, fix and rerun.
    Examples of important interactions: move, jump, shoot/attack, interact/use, select/confirm/cancel in menus, pause/resume, restart, and any special abilities or puzzle actions defined by the request. Multi-step examples: shooting an enemy should reduce its health; when health reaches 0 it should disappear and update the score; collecting a key should unlock a door and allow level progression.
12. **Check errors.** Review console errors and fix the first new issue before continuing.
13. **Reset between scenarios.** Avoid cross-test state when validating distinct features.
14. **Iterate with small deltas.** Change one variable at a time (frames, inputs, timing, positions), then repeat steps 7–13 until stable.

Example command (actions required):
```
node "$WEB_GAME_CLIENT" --url http://localhost:5173 --actions-file "$WEB_GAME_ACTIONS" --click-selector "#start-btn" --iterations 3 --pause-ms 250
```

Example actions (inline JSON):
```json
{
  "steps": [
    { "buttons": ["left_mouse_button"], "frames": 2, "mouse_x": 120, "mouse_y": 80 },
    { "buttons": [], "frames": 6 },
    { "buttons": ["right"], "frames": 8 },
    { "buttons": ["space"], "frames": 4 }
  ]
}
```

## Test Checklist

Test any new features added for the request and any areas your logic changes could affect. Identify issues, fix them, and re-run the tests to confirm they’re resolved.

Examples of things to test:
- Primary movement/interaction inputs (e.g., move, jump, shoot, confirm/select).
- Win/lose or success/fail transitions.
- Score/health/resource changes.
- Boundary conditions (collisions, walls, screen edges).
- Menu/pause/start flow if present.
- Any special actions tied to the request (powerups, combos, abilities, puzzles, timers).

## Test Artifacts to Review

- Latest screenshots from the Playwright run.
- Latest `render_game_to_text` JSON output.
- Console error logs (fix the first new error before continuing).
You must actually open and visually inspect the latest screenshots after running the Playwright script, not just generate them. Ensure everything that should be visible on screen is actually visible. Go beyond the start screen and capture gameplay screenshots that cover all newly added features. Treat the screenshots as the source of truth; if something is missing, it is missing in the build. If you suspect a headless/WebGL capture issue, rerun the Playwright script in headed mode and re-check. Fix and rerun in a tight loop until the screenshots and text state look correct. Once fixes are verified, re-test all important interactions and controls, confirm they work, and ensure your changes did not introduce regressions. If they did, fix them and rerun everything in a loop until interactions, text state, and controls all work as expected. Be exhaustive in testing controls; broken games are not acceptable.

## Core Game Guidelines

### Canvas + Layout
- Prefer a single canvas centered in the window.

### Visuals
- Keep on-screen text minimal; show controls on a start/menu screen rather than overlaying them during play.
- Avoid overly dark scenes unless the design calls for it. Make key elements easy to see.
- Draw the background on the canvas itself instead of relying on CSS backgrounds.

### Text State Output (render_game_to_text)
Expose a `window.render_game_to_text` function that returns a concise JSON string representing the current game state. The text should include enough information to play the game without visuals.

Minimal pattern:
```js
function renderGameToText() {
  const payload = {
    mode: state.mode,
    player: { x: state.player.x, y: state.player.y, r: state.player.r },
    entities: state.entities.map((e) => ({ x: e.x, y: e.y, r: e.r })),
    score: state.score,
  };
  return JSON.stringify(payload);
}
window.render_game_to_text = renderGameToText;
```

Keep the payload succinct and biased toward on-screen/interactive elements. Prefer current, visible entities over full history.
Include a clear coordinate system note (origin and axis directions), and encode all player-relevant state: player position/velocity, active obstacles/enemies, collectibles, timers/cooldowns, score, and any mode/state flags needed to make correct decisions. Avoid large histories; only include what's currently relevant and visible.

### Time Stepping Hook
Provide a deterministic time-stepping hook so the Playwright client can advance the game in controlled increments. Expose `window.advanceTime(ms)` (or a thin wrapper that forwards to your game update loop) and have the game loop use it when present.
The Playwright test script uses this hook to step frames deterministically during automated testing.

Minimal pattern:
```js
window.advanceTime = (ms) => {
  const steps = Math.max(1, Math.round(ms / (1000 / 60)));
  for (let i = 0; i < steps; i++) update(1 / 60);
  render();
};
```

### Fullscreen Toggle
- Use a single key (prefer `f`) to toggle fullscreen on/off.
- Allow `Esc` to exit fullscreen.
- When fullscreen toggles, resize the canvas/rendering so visuals and input mapping stay correct.

## Progress Tracking

Create a `progress.md` file if it doesn't exist, and append TODOs, notes, gotchas, and loose ends as you go so another agent can pick up seamlessly.
If a `progress.md` file already exists, read it first, including the original user prompt at the top (you may be continuing another agent's work). Do not overwrite the original prompt; preserve it.
Update `progress.md` after each meaningful chunk of work (feature added, bug found, test run, or decision made).
At the end of your work, leave TODOs and suggestions for the next agent in `progress.md`.

## Playwright Prerequisites

- Prefer a local `playwright` dependency if the project already has it.
- If unsure whether Playwright is available, check for `npx`:
  ```
  command -v npx >/dev/null 2>&1
  ```
- If `npx` is missing, install Node/npm and then install Playwright globally:
  ```
  npm install -g @playwright/mcp@latest
  ```
- Do not switch to `@playwright/test` unless explicitly asked; stick to the client script.

## Scripts

- `$WEB_GAME_CLIENT` (installed default: `$CODEX_HOME/skills/develop-web-game/scripts/web_game_playwright_client.js`) — Playwright-based action loop with virtual-time stepping, screenshot capture, and console error buffering. You must pass an action burst via `--actions-file`, `--actions-json`, or `--click`.

## References

- `$WEB_GAME_ACTIONS` (installed default: `$CODEX_HOME/skills/develop-web-game/references/action_payloads.json`) — example action payloads (keyboard + mouse, per-frame capture). Use these to build your burst.

description: "Use when the task involves reading, creating, or editing `.docx` documents, especially when formatting or layout fidelity matters; prefer `python-docx` plus the bundled `scripts/render_docx.py` for visual checks."
---


# DOCX Skill

## When to use
- Read or review DOCX content where layout matters (tables, diagrams, pagination).
- Create or edit DOCX files with professional formatting.
- Validate visual layout before delivery.

## Workflow
1. Prefer visual review (layout, tables, diagrams).
   - If `soffice` and `pdftoppm` are available, convert DOCX -> PDF -> PNGs.
   - Or use `scripts/render_docx.py` (requires `pdf2image` and Poppler).
   - If these tools are missing, install them or ask the user to review rendered pages locally.
2. Use `python-docx` for edits and structured creation (headings, styles, tables, lists).
3. After each meaningful change, re-render and inspect the pages.
4. If visual review is not possible, extract text with `python-docx` as a fallback and call out layout risk.
5. Keep intermediate outputs organized and clean up after final approval.

## Temp and output conventions
- Use `tmp/docs/` for intermediate files; delete when done.
- Write final artifacts under `output/doc/` when working in this repo.
- Keep filenames stable and descriptive.

## Dependencies (install if missing)
Prefer `uv` for dependency management.

Python packages:
```
uv pip install python-docx pdf2image
```
If `uv` is unavailable:
```
python3 -m pip install python-docx pdf2image
```
System tools (for rendering):
```
# macOS (Homebrew)
brew install libreoffice poppler

# Ubuntu/Debian
sudo apt-get install -y libreoffice poppler-utils
```

If installation isn't possible in this environment, tell the user which dependency is missing and how to install it locally.

## Environment
No required environment variables.

## Rendering commands
DOCX -> PDF:
```
soffice -env:UserInstallation=file:///tmp/lo_profile_$$ --headless --convert-to pdf --outdir $OUTDIR $INPUT_DOCX
```

PDF -> PNGs:
```
pdftoppm -png $OUTDIR/$BASENAME.pdf $OUTDIR/$BASENAME
```

Bundled helper:
```
python3 scripts/render_docx.py /path/to/file.docx --output_dir /tmp/docx_pages
```

## Quality expectations
- Deliver a client-ready document: consistent typography, spacing, margins, and clear hierarchy.
- Avoid formatting defects: clipped/overlapping text, broken tables, unreadable characters, or default-template styling.
- Charts, tables, and visuals must be legible in rendered pages with correct alignment.
- Use ASCII hyphens only. Avoid U+2011 (non-breaking hyphen) and other Unicode dashes.
- Citations and references must be human-readable; never leave tool tokens or placeholder strings.

## Final checks
- Re-render and inspect every page at 100% zoom before final delivery.
- Fix any spacing, alignment, or pagination issues and repeat the render loop.
- Confirm there are no leftovers (temp files, duplicate renders) unless the user asks to keep them.

# Figma MCP

Use the Figma MCP server for Figma-driven implementation. For setup and debugging details (env vars, config, verification), see `references/figma-mcp-config.md`.

## Figma MCP Integration Rules
These rules define how to translate Figma inputs into code for this project and must be followed for every Figma-driven change.

### Required flow (do not skip)
1. Run get_design_context first to fetch the structured representation for the exact node(s).
2. If the response is too large or truncated, run get_metadata to get the high-level node map and then re-fetch only the required node(s) with get_design_context.
3. Run get_screenshot for a visual reference of the node variant being implemented.
4. Only after you have both get_design_context and get_screenshot, download any assets needed and start implementation.
5. Translate the output (usually React + Tailwind) into this project's conventions, styles and framework. Reuse the project's color tokens, components, and typography wherever possible.
6. Validate against Figma for 1:1 look and behavior before marking complete.

### Implementation rules
- Treat the Figma MCP output (React + Tailwind) as a representation of design and behavior, not as final code style.
- Replace Tailwind utility classes with the project's preferred utilities/design-system tokens when applicable.
- Reuse existing components (e.g., buttons, inputs, typography, icon wrappers) instead of duplicating functionality.
- Use the project's color system, typography scale, and spacing tokens consistently.
- Respect existing routing, state management, and data-fetch patterns already adopted in the repo.
- Strive for 1:1 visual parity with the Figma design. When conflicts arise, prefer design-system tokens and adjust spacing or sizes minimally to match visuals.
- Validate the final UI against the Figma screenshot for both look and behavior.

### Asset handling
- The Figma MCP Server provides an assets endpoint which can serve image and SVG assets.
- IMPORTANT: If the Figma MCP Server returns a localhost source for an image or an SVG, use that image or SVG source directly.
- IMPORTANT: DO NOT import/add new icon packages, all the assets should be in the Figma payload.
- IMPORTANT: do NOT use or create placeholders if a localhost source is provided.

### Link-based prompting
- The server is link-based: copy the Figma frame/layer link and give that URL to the MCP client when asking for implementation help.
- The client cannot browse the URL but extracts the node ID from the link; always ensure the link points to the exact node/variant you want.

# PR Comment Handler

Guide to find the open PR for the current branch and address its comments with gh CLI. Run all `gh` commands with elevated network access.

Prereq: ensure `gh` is authenticated (for example, run `gh auth login` once), then run `gh auth status` with escalated permissions (include workflow/repo scopes) so `gh` commands succeed. If sandboxing blocks `gh auth status`, rerun it with `sandbox_permissions=require_escalated`.

## 1) Inspect comments needing attention
- Run scripts/fetch_comments.py which will print out all the comments and review threads on the PR

## 2) Ask the user for clarification
- Number all the review threads and comments and provide a short summary of what would be required to apply a fix for it
- Ask the user which numbered comments should be addressed

## 3) If user chooses comments
- Apply fixes for the selected comments

Notes:
- If gh hits auth/rate issues mid-run, prompt the user to re-authenticate with `gh auth login`, then retry.
