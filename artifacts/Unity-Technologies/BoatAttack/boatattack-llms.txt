# Boatattack

> The purpose of the "Boat Attack" project is to demonstrate and explore the capabilities of Unity's Universal Render Pipeline (URP), particularly through a small boat racing game with island environments. It serves as an educational resource for developers learning URP, shader graph usage, custom rendering pipelines, and performance optimization techniques. The project also showcases experimental features like Gerstner-based water systems, planar reflections via SRP callbacks, and Addressables asset management.

**Remember:**
- Universal Render Pipeline (URP)
- Shader Graph
- SRP Callbacks for Custom Rendering
- Addressables Asset Management
- Cinemachine Camera Systems
- Post-Processing with Volume Blending
