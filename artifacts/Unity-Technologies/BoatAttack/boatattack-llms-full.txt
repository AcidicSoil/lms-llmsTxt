   5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,
      any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work
      by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of
      this License, without any additional terms or conditions.
      Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify
      the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed
      with Licensor regarding such Contributions.

   6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade
      names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,
      except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the
      origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.

   7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or
      agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each

      whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,
      unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly
      negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
      liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
      incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
      result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
      Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
      work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
      other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
      has been advised of the possibility of such damages.

   9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing
      the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,
      and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,
      or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this
      License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only
      on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf
      of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,
      defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability
      incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason
      of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.

# Boat Attack
###### Demo Project using the Universal RP from Unity3D

[![Click for Youtube Video](https://media.githubusercontent.com/media/Verasl/BoatAttack/release/2019.3/Assets/Textures/UI/welcome-title.png)](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1PTNdhnqbhzSWUCfAinIefP5cfr6Dezuw/view)

This Unity project has been created to aid the testing and development of Universal RP. The project is a small vertical slice of a boat racing game, complete with race-able boats and island environment.

Feel free to post any issues, but know this is a 'as is' repo, it's meant more for discovery of how some of the Universal RP features work and a learning resource for some tricks.

**Project Features**:
  * Uses Universal RP from Unity
  * Mobile optimized, low poly, LODs, no compute
  * C# Jobs buoyancy system
  * Cinemachine camera setups
  * Shader Graph usage
  * Post-processing v3 with Volume blending
  * Addressables asset management package
  * Custom Universal RP rendering for planar reflections via [SRP callbacks](https://docs.unity3d.com/ScriptReference/Rendering.RenderPipelineManager.html)
  * Custom SciptableRenderPass usage for WaterFX and Caustics
  * Gerstner based water system in local package(WIP)
  * Much more..

# Usage

#### Getting the project
via Git:
  1. Make sure you have GitLFS installed, check [here](https://git-lfs.github.com) for details.
  2. Clone the repo as usual via cmd/terminal or in your favourite Git GUI software.
  3. Checkout the branch that matches the Unity verison you are using, eg `release/2019.3`

Downloadable zips:
  1. [2019.3 Project (Unity 2019.3f5)](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1vXpbVC36GHnyC-Eitl1WpLay9l_YqJGQ/view?usp=sharing)

#### Load the project:
Once you have the project files locally you can load the project, ideally in the Unity version that is noted in the `ProjectSettings/ProjectVersion.txt` for the best experience.
Upon loading the project will display a small welcome screen with some buttons to load starting scenes.

Scenes worth noting:
 - `scenes/main_menu.unity` - Starting menu scene if you want to have a full play-through of the demo.
 - `scenes/demo_island.unity` - Setup to play in the editor and go straight into an AI based race.
 - `scenes/_levels/level_Island.unity` - The scene loaded when entering from the main menu.
 - `scenes/Testing/***.unity` - Assorted test scenes, these are in need of updating and come as is.

#### Build the project:
One thing to make sure you do before building is make sure to build the addressable assets, this can be done via the addressables window, for more information please checkout the addressables [package documentation](https://docs.unity3d.com/Packages/com.unity.addressables@latest).
Once the addressable assets are built you can continue to build a player as usual.

One thing to mention is not all controls and platforms have been tested, especially for the menu work. if you want to just see the project running on a device you can add the `scenes/demo_island.unity` scene to the build list and disable/remove the others.

# Todo

As this project is on going there is a lot more left that needs to be worked on, so I repeat this is not a resource for production ready workflow ideas or systems and lots of it was put together very quickly.

Some of the things left to do:
 * Make water system more modular and improve UX
 * Improve boat AI
 * Add imposter rendering for vegetation
 * Cleanup menu system to switch between Demoing/Playing/Benchmarking
 * Implement Unity Physics
 * Optimize cross platform performance and stability
 * Continue code cleanup
 * Wiki explaining features/systems in more depth
 * Add more sizzle....
