# Upgrading

This section provides information about upgrading to new versions of this package.

(Since there are no new versions right now, we'll leave this page as is!)


--- Packages/com.unity.reference-project.persistence-api/README.md ---
# Replica - Persistence API 

This sample will showcase how the Persistence API can be used to script a Google Drive API client to be used for both local storage and cloud storage.

Input your token in the field and press "Send Screenshot".

Your screenshot will appear in the Result window, with the location of the screenshot shown below it.

You can click the "Open Screenshot" button to view saved screenshot.

The local path matches the url path allowing all of the same client requests to be called, whether the device is offline/online or you just want to quarantine all the data to a local device.
No need to write an entire new offline client, just change the base url when initializing the Persistence API and business as usual.

## Identifying new content

Tell me things like:

* What new things can they see that they haven’t seen before?
* What kinds of GameObjects or assets should they pay attention to?
* Are there special scripts that they need to add?

## Do any other settings, configurations, license issues, JSON files, accounts, or integrations need attention before we get to work?

> **Important**: Deprecation Notice: This project is no longer maintained

Last updated: 2025-10-17

Reference Project is deprecated and no longer supported or updated by Unity. Use the [Industry Viewer Template (IVT)](https://github.com/Unity-Technologies/unity-industry-viewer-template) for all new projects.

The IVT is a modern, actively supported template that provides a robust, feature-rich foundation for building industrial and enterprise applications with Unity.

Presence service: This service will be turned off on April 2026. The recommended alternative for real-time presence and multiplayer functionality is [Multiplay](https://services.docs.unity.com/matchmaker-admin/v3/), which is demonstrated in the Industry Viewer Template.

Annotation service: This service will also be turned off on April 2026. For Annotation and Collaboration features, use the [Collaboration SDK](https://docs.unity3d.com/Packages/com.unity.cloud.collaboration@latest), available as an experimental package.

## Overview

Software vendors creating custom industrial applications repeat similar steps to get started:

1. Create a Unity application
2. Build a 3D asset ingestion pipeline
3. Optimize for large models
4. Add collaborative tools
5. Add AR & VR functionality, etc.

This is expensive and takes away time they could be spending developing their unique value proposition targeted towards their industry or use case.

The Unity Cloud Reference Project is a Unity project intended as a starting point for industry developers, and is architected with customization and extensibility in mind. Developers can pull in changes from the latest release with minimal conflicts to their codebase and can easily remove unwanted features. It supports many build targets, empowering users to easily share their 3D assets for review.

### Customize

- Navigation modes (users can toggle between walk, fly, teleport, VR, or your own custom modes)
- Localization to support multiple languages in the user interface
- Tools and user interface elements (add, remove, and completely modify)
- Tools to support VR applications, such as virtual keyboards and other world-space user interfaces

### Integrate with Unity Cloud

- Authenticate with your Unity account or SSO
- Browse and view your 3D assets from the Unity Asset Manager
- Stream large 3D assets (skyscrapers, offshore drilling, cities) of vast 3D formats
- Collaborate online with multiuser avatars and voice chat
- Annotate your 3D assets with topics, threads, comments, and attachments

## Unit Definition
**Definitions** are a measurement system that, once defined, can be converted to an other **unit definition** to the same type.
For example, you can convert from *centimeter* **length** to *inches*.
Or you can convert from *cubic centimeter* to *liter*.
But you cannot convert from *gram* to *celsius* since *mass* is not the same type as *temperature*.

### Create a New Unit Definition
Many **Unit Definitions** are available in the unit systems `Si`, `Astro`, `Imperial`, `Misc`, `Money`, `Storey`, `Uscs`.
Still, if you need to create a new one, create a new instance of either `Angle`, `AngularArea`, `Area`, `Currency`, `Frequency`, `Length`, `Mass`, `Radioactivity`, `SubstanceAmount`, `Temperature`, `Time` or `Volume`.
And make sure you call the static constructor before using string decoding, otherwise your custom definition will not be considered.
<br/>
<br/>

## Unit
**Unit** strut is the encapsulation of a **unit definition**, its amount and its power value.
<br/>
<br/>

### Constructor
Creating a new **Unit** instance.

| units                | code                                         |
|----------------------|----------------------------------------------|
| 5 centimeters        | `Unit unit = new Unit(5, Si.Centimeter);`    |
| 5 square centimeters | `Unit unit = new Unit(5, Si.Centimeter, 2);` |
| 5 cubic centimeter   | `Unit unit = new Unit(5, Si.Centimeter, 3);` |
| 5 meters             | `Unit unit = Si.Meter.From(5);`              |

<br/>
<br/>

### Convert
Units can be converted to other **Unit Definitions** as long the **UnitDef** type is the same.
For example, you cannot convert from a **Length** to a **Temperature**.

```
Unit feet = new Unit(5, Imperial.Feet);
Unit cm = feet.To(Si.Centimeter);
```

### Operators
Mathematical operators are implemented and can be used between units even if the units are not using the same **UnitDef** (as long the type is the same).
The left operator side is the **Unit** defining the new **Unit.UnitDef**.

```
Unit cm = new Unit(5, Si.Centimeter);
Unit feet = new Unit(5, Imperial.Feet);

Unit totalCm = cm + feet - 3.0;
```
<br/>

Multiplication and division will set a new **Power** value if both sides are **Unit** instances.

```
Unit m = new Unit(2, Si.Meter);
Unit feet = new Unit(5, Imperial.Feet);

Unit squareResult = m * feet;  // 3.048 meters²
Unit linearResult = squareResult / m;  // 1.524 meters
```

```
Unit m = new Unit(2, Si.Meter);
Unit feet = new Unit(5, Imperial.Feet);

Unit cubicResult = m * feet * m;  // 6.096 meters³
Unit squareResult = cubicResult / feet;  // 4 meters²
Unit linearResult = squareResult / m;  // 2 meters
```

```
Unit m = new Unit(2, Si.Meter2);
Unit feet = new Unit(5, Imperial.Feet);

Unit cubicResult = m * feet;  // 3.048 meters³
```

```
Unit m = new Unit(2, Si.Meter);
Unit feet = new Unit(5, Imperial.Feet2);

Unit cubicResult = m * feet;  // 3.048 meters³
```
<br/>

Multiplying by a **double** will not change the **Power** value.
```
Unit m = new Unit(2, Si.Meter);
Unit linearResult = m * 2;  // 4 meters
Unit squareResult = m * m;  // 4 meters²
Unit result = squareResult / 2;  // 2 meters²
```
<br/>

You can also compare **Units** together as long the **UnitDef** type is the same.

```
Unit m = new Unit(2, Si.Meter);
Unit feet = new Unit(5, Imperial.Feet);

bool result = m > feet;  // true
```
<br/>
<br/>

### String Decoding
You can can decode units from strings, but since this is a longer process, it is better to the other
instantiation ways when possible. If you don't know the values (from a file for example), string decoding
is then the best way.

Be sure the string you give has only one **Unit** value. If multiple **Units** are part of the string,
it will merged to one allowing to convert imperial units as of `5'6"` would be converted to `5.5'`.

To decode one string when you don't know anything about the content:

| units         | code                             |
|---------------|----------------------------------|
| 5 centimeters | `Unit unit = Unit.From("5 cm");` |
| 5 meters      | `Unit unit = (Unit)"5cm";`       |
| 5 grams       | `Unit unit = Mass.From("5g");`   |

<br/>
<br/>

Some units uses the same symbol. To prevent wrong decoding and to accelerate the evaluation, it is better to
restrict the search to only the expected **Unit Definition** types.

| units         | code                                                                          |
|---------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| 5 feet        | `Unit unit = Unit.From("5'", typeof(Length));`                                |
| 5 arc minutes | `Unit unit = Unit.From<Angle>("5'");`                                         |
| 5 feet        | `Unit unit = Unit.From("5'", typeof(Length), typeof(Area), typeof(Volume));`  |
| 5 square feet | `Unit unit = Unit.From("5'²", typeof(Length), typeof(Area), typeof(Volume));` |
| 5 cubic feet  | `Unit unit = Unit.From("5'³", typeof(Length), typeof(Area), typeof(Volume));` |

<br/>
<br/>

When decoding one string with multiple unit values, the sum of them will be returned:

| units            | code                                              |
|------------------|---------------------------------------------------|
| 5.25 feet        | `Unit unit = Unit.From("5'3\"", typeof(Length));` |
| 5.25 arc minutes | `Unit unit = Unit.From<Angle>("5'15\"");`         |

<br/>
<br/>

That's why if you have list of unit values, you should split them before:

| units                          | code                                                                          |
|--------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| 12 meters                      | `Unit unit = Unit.From("5m;3m;4m");`                                          |
| {5 meters, 3 meters, 4 meters} | `Unit[] units = Unit.From("5m;3m;4m".Split(';')).ToArray();`                  |
| {5 feet, 3 feet, 4 feet}       | ```Unit[] units = Unit.From<Length>("5 ft;3';4feet".Split(';')).ToArray();``` |

<br/>
<br/>


## String Formatting
String formatters are included in the package, they can be configured and passed into the 
`Unit.ToString(IUnitFormatter)` and `Unit.ToFullString(IUnitFormatter)` methods or as an IFormatProvider for `String.Format()`

### UnitFormatter
Basic default unit formatter

`UnitFormatter(bool fullStringFormat = false, bool hasSuperscript = true, int decimalPrecision = Int32.MaxValue, int minimumPrecision = 0)`

| output                     | code                                                                                             |
|----------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| 5.75'                      | `Unit.From<Length>("5' 7 1/2\"").ToString();`                                                    |
| 5 centimeters              | `Unit.From<Length>("5cm").ToFullString();`                                                       |
| Area: 5 square centimeters | `String.Format(new UnitFormatter(fullStringFormat:true), "Area: {0}", Unit.From<Area>("5cm²"));` |
| 5.7 meters                 | `Si.Meter.From(5.68138).ToString(new UnitFormatter(fullStringFormat:true, decimalPrecision:1));` |

#### Full String Format
When true, the full string name & power are used when formatting. (Default: False)

#### Has Superscript
When true, if the passed unit has a power higher than 1 then the resulting string will include the power or superscript symbol. 
(Default: True)

#### Decimal Precision
The maximum zero place to output when formatting values. (Default: Int32.MaxValue)

#### Minimum Precision
The minimum zero place to output when formatting values. (Default: 0)



### FractionalUnitFormatter
Formats units so decimal values are fractions. This is common with Imperial units.

`FractionalUnitFormatter(bool fullStringFormat = false, bool hasSuperscript = false, int precision = 16, bool richText = false)`

| output     | code                                                                              |
|------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| 1 1/2 Cups | `Uscs.Cup.From(1.5).ToString(new FractionalUnitFormatter(fullStringFormat:true))` |
| 7/8"       | `Imperial.Inch.From(0.859).ToString(new FractionalUnitFormatter(precision:8));`   |
| 1/4 Mile   | `Imperial.Mile.From(0.25).ToString(new FractionalUnitFormatter());`               |

#### Full String Format
When true, the full string name & power are used when formatting. (Default: False)

#### Has Superscript
When true, if the passed unit has a power higher than 1 then the resulting string will include the power or superscript symbol.
(Default: True)

#### Precision
The finest precision that should be used, the value should be a power of 2. 8 = 1/8, 16 = 1/16, 32 = 1/32. (Default: 16)

#### Rich Text
When true, the fraction is wrapped in rich text symbols `<sup>` and `<sub>` for TextMeshPro & HTML. (Default: False)



### MultiUnitFormatter
Converts a single unit into a composite of output units where the remainder of larger units is 
converted into smaller units. Each value is formatted with [UnitFormatter](#UnitFormatter), and concatenated into the output string.

`MultiUnitFormatter(IUnitDef[] units, bool dropZeroScales = true, bool fullStringFormat = false, bool hasSuperscript = true, int decimalPrecision = Int32.MaxValue, int minimumPrecision = 0)`

#### Units
List of Unit Definitions passed in the order they are printed. The remainder of an integer of the first value is passed 
to the second, for that reason it is recommended to order the values from larger to smaller.

#### Drop Zero Scales
When set to true, if a unit would print a zero then it would be ignored unless it's the only unit. (Default: True)

#### Full String Format
When true, the full string name & power are used when formatting. (Default: False)

#### Has Superscript
When true, if the passed unit has a power higher than 1 then the resulting string will include the power or superscript symbol.
(Default: True)

#### Decimal Precision
The maximum zero place to output when formatting values. (Default: Int32.MaxValue)

#### Minimum Precision
The minimum zero place to output when formatting values. (Default: 0)



### MultiFractionalUnitFormatter
Converts a single unit into a composite of output units where the remainder of larger units is
converted into smaller units. Each value is formatted with [FractionalUnitFormatter](#FractionalUnitFormatter), and concatenated into the output string.

`MultiFractionalUnitFormatter(IUnitDef[] units, bool dropZeroScales = true, bool fullStringFormat = false, bool hasSuperscript = false, int precision = 16, bool richText = false)`

#### Units
List of Unit Definitions passed in the order they are printed. The remainder of an integer of the first value is passed
to the second, for that reason it is recommended to order the values from larger to smaller.

#### Drop Zero Scales
When set to true, if a unit would print a zero then it would be ignored unless it's the only unit. (Default: True)

#### Full String Format
When true, the full string name & power are used when formatting. (Default: False)

#### Has Superscript
When true, if the passed unit has a power higher than 1 then the resulting string will include the power or superscript symbol.
(Default: True)

#### Precision
The finest precision that should be used, the value should be a power of 2. 8 = 1/8, 16 = 1/16, 32 = 1/32. (Default: 16)

#### Rich Text
When true, the fraction is wrapped in rich text symbols `<sup>` and `<sub>` for TextMeshPro & HTML. (Default: False)

# Package documentation guides

Use these guides to create preliminary, high-level documentation meant to introduce users to the feature and the sample files included in your package.

There are several types of packages:

* Packages that include features that augment the Unity Editor or Runtime (**modules**, **tools**, and **libraries**).

* Packages that provide **tests**.

* Packages that include **sample** files.

* Packages that contain **templates**.

	> **Note:** Use the specialized [com.unity.template-starter-kit](https://github.cds.internal.unity3d.com/unity/com.unity.template-starter-kit) starter kit for templates.

Simple packages usually only need a single MD file for documentation. For example, packages that contain only samples or tests that require a minimal explanation. For single-file documentation, use the package name as the filename with the MD extension. For example, if your package is named **com.unity.small-package**, name your documentation file *com.unity.small-package.md*.

If you are providing a package that contains a lot of tools, or requires a lot of explanation, you probably need to create more than one page of documentation. Multiple-page documentation provides a lot of information with a sidebar Table of Contents (TOC) where readers can easily see and understand the structure.

## How to use these guides

This documentation set itself is an example of how to set up more complex documentation with multiple pages organized with a Table of Contents (TOC). However, you can also use these pages as guides for how to create single-page documentation:

* [tools-package-guide.md](tools-package-guide.md) for a package that includes features that augment the Unity Editor or Runtime (modules, tools, and libraries)
* [sample-package-guide.md](sample-package-guide.md) for a package that includes sample files
* [test-package-guide.md](test-package-guide.md) for a package that provides tests

> **Tip**: You can also use the single-page guides to help create more complex documentation: start with one big MD file and then split it out later when you are happy with the structure.
>
> Alternatively, you can create the overall structure in the *TableOfContents.md* file and then create the individual MD files as you go along. For more information on using multi-page documentation, see the Confluence page [User Manual formatting (packages)](https://confluence.unity3d.com/pages/viewpage.action?pageId=59048227).

The guide pages contain some example text to get you started, along with some instructions displayed as **Notes**. In addition, there are a few real-world examples displayed *in italics* which are there for reference only. Delete all of the instructions and examples, and then remove any other sections or text you don't need.

When you want to review the overall structure or test how the documentation will look online, use the Package Manager's **DocTools** extension. For more information, see the instructions on Confluence for  [installing the DocTools package](https://confluence.unity3d.com/display/DOCS/The+DocTools+package). Then open your package in the Package Manager and click the **Generate Documentation** button. DocFx generates a version using your localserver.

### Markdown for single vs. multiple MD files

If you are creating a single MD file for your documentation, you can use a Heading 1 section to add more topics. Use the **#** character followed by your title:

```markdown
# Heading 1 section
Here are the contents of your main topic.
```

If you need to split a main topic into smaller subtopics, use a Heading 2 section:

```markdown
## Heading 2 section
Here are the contents of your subtopic.
```

If you are creating documentation with a Table of Contents and multiple MD files, you can put each main topic in its own page. Other than that, you can use virtually the same markdown. The only real difference is when creating links.

### Links to other topics

If you want to link to a specific topic, add an anchor (bookmark) just before the heading:

```markdown
<a name="anchorID"></a>
# Heading 1 section
Here are the contents of your main topic.
```

> **Note**: Anchor links must be unique inside an MD file.

If the topic you are linking to is defined in the same file as the link, add a markdown link to the anchorID you used:

```markdown
...
And here is the text where the [link](#anchorID) appears.
...

<a name="anchorID"></a>
# Heading 1 section
Here are the contents of your main topic.
```

If the topic you are linking to is defined in a different file from the link, use the name of the page first:

```markdown
This is what an [external link](anotherfile.md#anchorID) looks like.
```

If you are linking to a topic that comes first in another file, you can just use the name of the page on its own:

```markdown
This is what a [link to another page](anotherfile.md) looks like.
```

Notice that in both cases, you have to specify the `.md` extension in the link text.

### Images

If you have topics that include screen grabs or diagrams, add a link to the image after the paragraph with the instruction or description that references the image. In addition, a caption should be added to the image link that includes the name of the screen or diagram. All images must be PNG files with underscores for spaces. No animated GIFs.

Here is an example of how to present a screen grab:

![A cinematic in the Timeline Editor window.](images/example.png)

Notice that the example screen shot is included in the images folder. All screen grabs and/or diagrams must be added and referenced from the images folder.

For information and guidance on creating and adding screen grabs, see [the Unity documentation standards](https://unity-docs.gitbook.io/style-guide/format/images/screenshots).

## Structuring the information

Most people need some orientation so they can understand what the purpose of the package is and what it contains, along with any important warnings or general information. This high-level information should appear in the [First page or section](#initial).

After providing this preliminary information, you can provide sections that contain:

* An overview of the user interface (if it's complicated)
* Directory listings (for samples)
* More in-depth workflows
* More advanced topics.
* Reference pages should appear near the end.

> **Tip:** For guidance on good writing practices, Unity documentation standards, and style guidelines, see the [Unity Docs Style Guide](https://unity-docs.gitbook.io/style-guide/).



<a name="initial"></a>

### First page or section

The initial section of the documentation should contain this information:

| **Subsection** | **Instructions/Description**                                 |
| ------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **Title** and introduction | The title of the package (for example, **About MyPackage**).<br /><br />After the title of the package, you should give a very brief overview of what the package does and what it contains. |
| **Experimental package**, **Pre-release package**, or **Installation** | The guides provide some boilerplate text inside of HTML comments (so they won't be generated by accident). Pick the appropriate section and move it out of the HTML comments.<br /><br />These sections include instructions for installing the package, which is a different procedure when your package is in early stages, so it's important to pick the appropriate section and change or remove that section when your package changes states. You should also provide any additional instructions to help the user complete the setup if necessary.<br /><br />Following the introduction, add the section that matches your package's state:<br /><br />- For packages that are In Development or Experimental, use the **Experimental package** section.<br />- For packages that are Pre-release, use the **Pre-release package** section.<br />- For packages that are Release Candidates or Released, use the **Installation** section. |
| **Package contents** | This section includes the location of important files you want the user to know about. For example, if this is a sample package containing textures, models, and materials separated by sample groups, you may want to provide the folder location of each group. |
| **Requirements** | [Optional] If your package requires anything other than the standard Unity system requirements, add this section. |
| **Known limitations** | [Optional] If your package has unresolved issues or limitations, enumerate them in this section. |
| **Helpful links** | [Optional] You can use this section to provide links for getting help and providing feedback, such as public forums or knowledge bases, helpdesk contacts, tutorials, and more. |

### Subsequent pages or sections

These are the suggested main topics you can add to your documentation after the first page or section:

| **Section**                                        | **Instructions/Description**                                 |
| -------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **Using &lt;package-name&gt;**                     | For packages that augment the Unity Editor with additional features, this section should include a high-level workflow. If there is more workflow, or it you need to provide more detail, consider adding a **Workflows** section. <br /><br />You can also include some information about your UI if your package implements a dialog, window, or component. If you have more than one set of properties or UI to document, consider adding a **Reference** section.<br /><br />For packages that include test or sample files, this section may include detailed information on how the user can use these in their Projects and Scenes. You can also include workflow diagrams or illustrations if it helps explain how to use your tests or samples. <br /><br />If this section begins to get really large, you can either divide it into smaller subsections or move some of the information to a new topic, including the **Workflows**, **Advanced topics**, or **Reference** sections. |
| [Workflows](tools-package-guide.md#Workflows)      | [Optional] <br />This is where you can describe typical ways to use the tools, modules, libraries, etc. A workflow is a simple set of steps that the user can easily follow. Workflows demonstrate how to use the feature.<br /><br />Provide a list of steps containing screen grabs to better illustrate how to use the feature, and links to the [more advanced topics](#Advanced) or any [reference pages](#Reference). |
| [Advanced topics](tools-package-guide.md#Advanced) | [Optional] <br />This is where you can provide detailed information about what you are providing to users. This is ideal if you don't want to overwhelm the user with too much information up front. You can link to topics by dropping an anchor (`<a name="AnchorID"></a>`) near the topic target and then creating an MD link with that anchor ID (`[display text for the link](#AnchorID)`) from another section.<br /><br />If you have a lot of advanced topics, you can create subsections and display a list of links to each one so your readers can easily find what they are looking for. |
| [Reference](tools-package-guide.md#Reference)      | [Optional] <br />If you have user interace with a lot of properties, you can provide the details in a reference section. Use tables, if possible, to describe properties. Reference tables should have two columns with the bolded name of the property on the left and the description of how to use it on the right.test-package-guide.md#reference) |



> **Remember**: You don't have to stick to these exact sections. You can define your own topics, as long as you generally follow these principles:
>
> * Provide some high-level information up front to orient your users.
> * Provide the low-level information (such as properties reference) at the end.
> * Provide the rest of the information in a series of topics in the middle. Depending on the complexity of your package, you might only have one topic after the introduction, or you might have several topics with sub-topics.
> * Provide links to separate topics and sections that are related to give the user the fullest picture possible.
