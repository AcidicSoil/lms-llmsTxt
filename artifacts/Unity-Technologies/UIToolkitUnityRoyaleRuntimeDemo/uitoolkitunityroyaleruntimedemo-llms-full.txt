# UI Toolkit Unity Royale Runtime Demo

Sample project to showcase the use of UI Toolkit for Runtime based on the [Unity Royale project](https://github.com/ciro-unity/UnityRoyale-Public).

With this project we demo the use of UXML and USS files to build Runtime UI. Through the use of the UI Builder, you can author UI easily and see the results in the Game View when the UXML is set to a `UIDocument` Component in the scene, using a `PanelSettings` Asset to provide information such as scaling.

This demo project is in development and updates/fixes will be done.

Unity Royale is card-based tower defence game made to showcases URP and custom shaders, Addressables, Timeline Signals, and more.

## Instalation

Tested with **Unity 2020.1.0f1**

## Contact

If you have any questions about this example, join us on the [UI Toolkit Unity Forum](https://forum.unity.com/forums/ui-toolkit.178/).

## Building

This project uses Addressables and you need to build those if you want to create an executable of the project. Find the AddressableAssetSettings under Assets/AddressableAssetsData, select "Manage Groups" on the Inspector and click Build

// IMPORTANT!!! /////////////////////////////////////////////
// Upgrading DOTween from versions older than 1.2.000 ///////
// (or DOTween Pro older than 1.0.000) //////////////////////
-------------------------------------------------------------
If you're upgrading your project from a version of DOTween older than 1.2.000 (or DOTween Pro older than 1.0.000) please follow these instructions carefully.
1) Import the new version in the same folder as the previous one, overwriting old files. A lot of errors will appear but don't worry
2) Close and reopen Unity (and your project). This is fundamental: skipping this step will cause a bloodbath
3) Open DOTween's Utility Panel (Tools > Demigiant > DOTween Utility Panel) if it doesn't open automatically, then press "Setup DOTween...": this will run the upgrade setup
4) From the Add/Remove Modules panel that opens, activate/deactivate Modules for Unity systems and for external assets (Pro version only)

// GET STARTED //////////////////////////////////////////////

- After importing a new DOTween update, select DOTween's Utility Panel from the "Tools/Demigiant" menu (if it doesn't open automatically) and press the "Setup DOTween..." button to activate/deactivate Modules. You can also access a Preferences Tab from there to choose default settings for DOTween.
- In your code, add "using DG.Tweening" to each class where you want to use DOTween.
- You're ready to tween. Check out the links below for full documentation and license info.
