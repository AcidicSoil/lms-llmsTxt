# Getting Started with Unity Toon Shader

The **Unity Toon Shader (UTS)** provides extensive controls 
for professional cel-shading across the Built-in Render Pipeline, URP, and HDRP. 
This page walks through the key concepts of cel-shading step by step.

Follow these steps for simple cel-shading:
1. [Put a directional light in the scene](#put-a-directional-light-in-the-scene).
2. [Create materials for cel-shading and set the appropriate shader](#creating-a-new-material-and-applying-unity-toon-shader).
3. [Set up three basic colors](#setting-up-three-basic-colors).
4. [Determine the character's visual style](#adjusting-the-edges-of-the-three-basic-color-regions).
5. [Set up the outline](#set-up-the-outline).

After mastering the basics, explore:

- [Advanced techniques](#advanced-techniques) such as:
    * [Eliminating outlines around eyes](#eliminating-outlines-around-eyes).
    * [Adding luster to hair](#adding-luster-to-hair).
- [More options for stunning professional cel-shading](#more-options-for-stunning-professional-cel-shading) to push the look further.

## Put a directional light in the scene

To make cel-shading work, you need to place at least one [directional light](https://docs.unity3d.com/2022.2/Documentation/Manual/Lighting.html) in the scene. 
Start with a neutral white light so you can see how UTS-specific settings influence the shading 
without additional color shifts.

## Creating a new material and applying Unity Toon Shader

Start by [creating a material](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/Manual/materials-introduction.html) for your mesh and then assign the UTS shader:

1. Create a new material and assign it to the mesh you plan to shade.
2. In the Inspector, choose **Toon > Toon** or **Toon > Toon (Tessellation)** from the Shader drop-down. 
   These shaders work on all supported render pipelines: Built-in Render Pipeline, URP, and HDRP.
3. Once assigned, the model will render as a flat silhouette until 
   you provide the texture maps that define the cel-shaded look.

![The same character model with the Toon shader selected in the Inspector window. The model is now a flat white silhouette.](images/AppliedUTS.png)

The directional light will no longer control shading in the usual way because UTS overrides the lighting response according to artist-driven parameters. UTS also allows you to decide whether and how the directional light color influences materials. See [Scene Light Effectiveness Settings](SceneLight.md) for guidance.

## Setting up three basic colors

UTS renders meshes in three conceptual regions: 
1. **Base Map** for lit areas
2. **1st Shading Map** for lighter shadows, and
3. **2nd Shading Map** for the darkest tones. 

For basic cel-shading you can focus on the Base Map and 1st Shading Map. 
The [Three Color Map and Control Map Settings](Basic.md) page explains the controls in depth.

![The same character model with the same shader selected. The Base Map property and the 1st Shading Map properties in the Inspector window are set to UV texture maps that have the shapes and colors for the model. The character is now fully textured.](images/AppliedTextures.png)

Follow these steps:
1. Author or import textures for the Base Map and 1st Shading Map. They can be separate textures or the same texture colored differently.
2. Assign the Base Map to define the fully lit colors.
3. Assign the 1st Shading Map to introduce a darker tone that UTS will show based on your shading step settings.


![UV map textures of a chibi-style model for lit and lighter shadows areas](images/UnityChanTextures.png)<br/>
Left: an example Base Map. Right: an example 1st Shading Map.


## Adjusting the edges of the three basic color regions

The borders between your color regions drive the perceived style of the character. 
[Shading Steps and Feather Settings](ShadingStepAndFeather.md) let you adjust the position of those borders 
and whether they are sharp or blended.

Follow these steps:
1. Increase **Base Color Step** so the **1st Shading Map** becomes visible and the contrast between lit and shadowed regions matches your intent.
2. Use **Base Shading Feather** to control how crisply the regions transition. Lower values create graphic, posterized shading, while higher values blend the regions.

![The same character model. In the Inspector window of the Toon shader, the Base Color Step property is set to 0.609. The shadows on the model are more prominent.](images/WithoutOutline.png)

![The same character model. In the Inspector window of the Toon shader, the Base Shading Feather property is set to 0.279. The shadows on the model are more blended.](images/AdjustingFeather.png)

## Set up the outline

Outline is another important factor that determines the animation style.
Consider the outline color relative to your background and adjust the thickness to reinforce the style. 
The [Outline Settings](Outline.md) page details every property.

<canvas class="image-comparison" role="img" aria-label="The same character model. In the Inspector window of the Toon shader, the Outline Color property is set to gray, and the Outline Width property is set to 4, then 6.44.">
    <img src="images/ThinOutline2.png" title="Outline Width: 4">
    <img src="images/BoldOutline2.png" title="Outline Width: 6.44">
</canvas>
<br />Drag the slider to compare the images.

## Advanced techniques

Now that you've learned basic cel-shading, you can refine specific features of the character. 
The following examples illustrate how UTS helps solve common cel-shading challenges.

### Eliminating outlines around eyes

Outlines around delicate facial features can be distracting. 
Apply an [Outline Width Map](Outline.md#outline-width-map) to control outline thickness per texel so you can taper or remove the stroke where needed.

![The same character model. In the Inspector window of the Toon shader, the Outline Width Map property is set to a texture. There's no longer an outline around the eyes of the character.](images/OutlineWidthMap3.png)

### Adding luster to hair

Flat lighting can make hair feel lifeless. 
Combine the [Highlight](Highlight.md), [Angel Ring](AngelRing.md), and [Material Capture (MatCap)](MatCap.md) features to add dimensionality. 
In this example, we'll apply a [MatCap map](MatCap.md#matcap-map) onto the hair.

![The same character model. In the Inspector window of the Toon shader, the MatCap Map property is set to a texture. The shadows and outlines on the hair look more three-dimensional.](images/Luster3.png)

## More options for stunning professional cel-shading

Once you're comfortable with the steps above, experiment with these additional features to push the look even further:

- [Emission](Emission.md) for glowing elements such as eyes, screens, or weapons.
- [Normal Map](NormalMap.md) to control the bumpiness of the material.
- [Rim Light](Rimlight.md) to highlight the edges of meshes.

# Unity Toon Shader overview

![An image from the toon-shaded film The Phantom Knowledge in the Scene view of the Unity Editor. A close-up of a girl raising a weapon with a ruined cityscape in the background.](com.unity.toonshader/Documentation~/images/TPK_04.png)

The **Unity Toon Shader** (UTS3) is a set of toon shaders designed to meet the needs of creators working on cel-shaded 3D-CG animations.

The **Unity Toon Shader** is compatible with all render pipelines: the **Built-in Render Pipeline**, the **Universal Render Pipeline (URP)**, and the **High Definition Render Pipeline (HDRP)**. However, there are some differences in the features supported by different render pipelines. Please refer to [Feature Difference](com.unity.toonshader/Documentation~/FeatureModel_en.md) for details about each render pipeline.

**Unity Toon Shader** is the successor to **Unity-chan Toon Shader ver 2.0 (UTS2)**, which was popular for years in games and animations. However, UTS2 was designed solely for the **Built-in Render Pipeline**, consisted of many different shaders, could not be installed through the [Package Manager window](https://docs.unity3d.com/Manual/upm-ui.html), and had a different license from other Unity software.

## Features of Unity Toon Shader

In animation production, color specialists specify detailed color designs for every scene. UTS can apply these color specifications as written in the design instructions. UTS allows users to apply specific colors for light and shadow areas regardless of the actual light colors in the scene. This feature is essential for cel-shaded character designs. UTS provides detailed control over whether the directional light color affects materials.

Typical color design instruction example:

![A stylized girl in a sailor uniform. A: White highlights on the hair. B: The main blonde hair color. C: Hair in shadow, with a tan color. D: Hair in darker shadow, with a darker tan color.](com.unity.toonshader/Documentation~/images/UTS4Color2.png)

- A: Highlight Color
- B: Base Color
- C: 1st Shading Color
- D: 2nd Shading Color

Three basic colors—**base color**, **1st shading color**, and **2nd shading color**—play key roles in character design with the **Unity Toon Shader**. Please refer to [Three Color Map and Control Map Settings](com.unity.toonshader/Documentation~/Basic.md) for more information.

Besides the three basic colors, the **Unity Toon Shader** provides a wide variety of features such as [Highlight](Highlight.md), [Rim Light](Rimlight.md), [Emission](Emission.md), [Angel Ring](AngelRing.md), [Material Capture (MatCap)](com.unity.toonshader/Documentation~/MatCap.md), and some special maps.

To get started with cel-shading, see [Getting Started](com.unity.toonshader/Documentation~/GettingStarted.md).

## Render Pipeline Compatibility
The **Unity Toon Shader** supports 3D projects across the **Built-in Render Pipeline**,
**Universal Render Pipeline (URP)**, and **High Definition Render Pipeline (HDRP)**.

For 2D projects, starting with Unity 6.3, the **Unity Toon Shader** partially supports URP 
by rendering 3D GameObjects in 2D URP scenes.

Feature availability varies between pipelines and between 3D/2D projects.   
Please review the [feature differences](com.unity.toonshader/Documentation~/FeatureModel_en.md) to confirm which features are supported in your target pipeline:

> The use of linear color space is strongly recommended.

# Unity Toon Shader Generator

This tool helps maintain consistency between `UnityToon.shader` and `UnityToonTessellation.shader` by using a single source of truth for shared properties.

## Files

- **CommonProperties.shaderblock**: Plain text list of shared property definitions (no Shader wrapper) with original comments preserved (`Packages/com.unity.toonshader/Runtime/Shaders/Common/Parts/`)
- **TessellationProperties.shaderblock**: Plain text list of tessellation-only property definitions (no Shader wrapper) (`Packages/com.unity.toonshader/Runtime/Shaders/Common/Parts/`)
- **ShaderGenerator.cs**: Unity Editor script (now located in the graphics test package) that generates the shader files from the property assets

## How to Use

1. **Edit Properties**:
   - Modify the plain-text part files under `Packages/com.unity.toonshader/Runtime/Shaders/Common/Parts/`
   - The files contain only property declarations, so standard ShaderLab property syntax applies

2. **Generate Shader Files**:
   - In Unity, choose `Toon Shader > Generate Shader Files`
   - The tool will automatically:
     - Replace the Properties blocks in both shader files
     - Preserve all other shader content (HLSLINCLUDE, SubShaders, etc.)

## Property File Format

Each property file is plain text containing only property declarations, e.g.

```
// Comments are preserved
[HideInInspector] _simpleUI ("SimpleUI", Int ) = 0
[Enum(OFF, 0, ON, 1)] _isUnityToonshader("Material is touched by Unity Toon Shader", Int) = 1
_BaseColor ("BaseColor", Color) = (1,1,1,1)
```

You can use the usual ShaderLab property syntax, including comments and blank lines. The generator indents/layers them into the target shaders automatically.

## Benefits

- **Single Source of Truth**: All shared properties are defined in one place
- **Consistency**: Ensures both shader files have identical shared properties
- **Maintainability**: Easy to add, remove, or modify properties across both shaders
- **Preservation**: All non-Properties content and comments are preserved during generation
- **Comment Preservation**: All original comments from the Properties blocks are maintained
- **Traceability**: Each generated shader receives an `//Auto-generated on ...` timestamp banner at the top

## Manual Generation (Alternative)

If you prefer to generate shaders manually, you can run the Python helper from the repository root:

```bash
cd /workspace
python3 generate_UnityToon.py
```

Convenience launchers are provided as `generate_UnityToon.sh` and `generate_UnityToon.bat`.

## Troubleshooting

- **Properties block not found**: Ensure the shader files have a valid `Properties { }` block
- **File not found errors**: Check that the property files exist in the correct paths
- **Generation fails**: Check the Unity Console for detailed error messages

# Unity Toon Shader overview

![An image from the toon-shaded film The Phantom Knowledge in the Scene view of the Unity Editor. A close-up of a girl raising a weapon with a ruined cityscape in the background.](images/TPK_04.png)

The **Unity Toon Shader** (UTS3) is a set of toon shaders designed to meet the needs of creators working on cel-shaded 3D-CG animations.

The **Unity Toon Shader** is compatible with all render pipelines: the **Built-in Render Pipeline**, the **Universal Render Pipeline (URP)**, and the **High Definition Render Pipeline (HDRP)**. However, there are some differences in the features supported by different render pipelines. Please refer to [Feature Difference](FeatureModel_en.md) for details about each render pipeline.

**Unity Toon Shader** is the successor to **Unity-chan Toon Shader ver 2.0 (UTS2)**, which was popular for years in games and animations. However, UTS2 was designed solely for the **Built-in Render Pipeline**, consisted of many different shaders, could not be installed through the [Package Manager window](https://docs.unity3d.com/Manual/upm-ui.html), and had a different license from other Unity software.

## Features of Unity Toon Shader

In animation production, color specialists specify detailed color designs for every scene. UTS can apply these color specifications as written in the design instructions. UTS allows users to apply specific colors for light and shadow areas regardless of the actual light colors in the scene. This feature is essential for cel-shaded character designs. UTS provides detailed control over whether the directional light color affects materials.

Typical color design instruction example:

![A stylized girl in a sailor uniform. A: White highlights on the hair. B: The main blonde hair color. C: Hair in shadow, with a tan color. D: Hair in darker shadow, with a darker tan color.](images/UTS4Color2.png)

- A: Highlight Color
- B: Base Color
- C: 1st Shading Color
- D: 2nd Shading Color

Three basic colors—**base color**, **1st shading color**, and **2nd shading color**—play key roles in character design with the **Unity Toon Shader**. Please refer to [Three Color Map and Control Map Settings](Basic.md) for more information.

Besides the three basic colors, the **Unity Toon Shader** provides a wide variety of features such as [Highlight](Highlight.md), [Rim Light](Rimlight.md), [Emission](Emission.md), [Angel Ring](AngelRing.md), [Material Capture (MatCap)](MatCap.md), and some special maps.

To get started with cel-shading, see [Getting Started](GettingStarted.md).

## Render Pipeline Compatibility
The **Unity Toon Shader** supports 3D projects across the **Built-in Render Pipeline**,
**Universal Render Pipeline (URP)**, and **High Definition Render Pipeline (HDRP)**.

For 2D projects, starting with Unity 6.3, the **Unity Toon Shader** partially supports URP 
by rendering 3D GameObjects in 2D URP scenes.

Feature availability varies between pipelines and between 3D/2D projects.   
Please review the [feature differences](FeatureModel_en.md) to confirm which features are supported in your target pipeline:

> The use of linear color space is strongly recommended.

# Angel Ring Projection Settings

The Angel Ring effect for UTS expresses shine or luster in hair. 
This effect always appears in a fixed position as seen from the camera.

Angel Ring requires:
1. [Unity Toon Shader mode](Modes.md) set to **With Additional Control Maps**.
2. 2nd UV in the model.

  - [Alpha Channel as Clipping Mask](#alpha-channel-as-clipping-mask)

## Angel Ring Projection
Enable the Angel Ring effect for UTS, which expresses shine or luster in hair.

### Angel Ring
Angel Ring: Texture(sRGB) × Color(RGB). Default: Black.

**Unity Toon Shader** adds the color to the lighting results, and 
you can also clip the effect using the alpha of the texture.
See [Alpha Channel as Clipping Mask](#alpha-channel-as-clipping-mask) for details.


![A dark square texture, with lighter v-shaped areas at the left and right edges.](images/para_height2.png)<br/>
Angel Ring Texture Example

### Offset U and V

* Offset U: Adjusts the Angel Ring's shape in the horizontal direction.
* Offset V: Adjusts the Angel Ring’s shape in the vertical direction.

<video title="The head of a chibi-style character, oriented face-on. The v-shaped highlights in the hair grow and shrink vertically, and move up and down." src="images/AngelRingOffsetUV_1.mp4" width="auto" height="auto" autoplay="true" loop="true" controls></video>

### Alpha Channel as Clipping Mask

The texture's alpha channel acts as a clipping mask. When disabled, alpha has no effect.

<br><br>

## Three Basic Color Maps

## Base Map
Base Color: Texture(sRGB) × Color(RGB). The default color is white. The base color represents the color of the unshaded areas of objects or characters.

|  Base Color Map (Face) | (Hair) | Result  |
| ---- | ---- |---- |
| <img alt="A yellow texture map with different-colored areas for skin, ears, eyes, cheeks, and other parts of a face." src="images/yuko_face3_main.png" height="256">  | <img alt="A grey texture map with two brown areas for cat-like ears, and lighter grey brushstrokes for parts of the hair." src="images/yuko_hair.png" height="256"> |<img alt="A chibi-style face with yellow skin, grey hair, brown cat ears, large eyes, and rosy cheeks." src="images/YukoFace.png" height="256">  |


### Apply to 1st Shading Map
Apply **Base Map** to the **1st Shading Map**. When you check **Apply to 1st Shading Map**, the texture map in **1st Shading Map** is not applied for rendering and the Inspector window disables its texture UI.


## 1st Shading Map
The map used for the brighter portions of the shadow. Texture(sRGB) × Color(RGB). The default color is white.

|   **1st Shading Map** (Face) | (Hair) | Result  |
| ---- | ---- | ---- |
| <img alt="A similar texture map to the base map, but the background is now tan." src="images/yuko_face3_B.png" height="256">   | <img alt="A similar hair map to the base map, but the background is darker, and the brushstrokes have a blue gradient." src="images/yuko_hairB.png" height="256"> |<img alt="The chibi-style face, now with shadows at the bottom of the hair and face, and over the eyes." src="images/YukoFace1stShadingMap.png" height="256">  |


### Apply to 2nd Shading Map
Apply **Base Map** or the **1st Shading Map** to the **2nd Shading Map**. When you check **Apply to 2nd Shading Map**, the texture map in **2nd Shading Map** is not applied for rendering and the Inspector window disables its texture UI.


### 2nd Shading Map
The map used for the darker portions of the shadow. Texture(sRGB) × Color(RGB). The default color is white.

|  **2nd Shading Map** (Face)  | (Hair) | Result  |
| ---- | ---- | ---- |
| <img alt="A similar texture map to the base map, but the background is now a dark orange." src="images/yuko_face3_C.png" height="256">   | <img alt="A similar hair map to the base map, but the background is even darker." src="images/yuko_hairC.png" height="256"> |<img alt="The chibi-style face, now with darker shadows at the edges of the hair." src="images/YukoFace2ndShadingMap.png" height="256">  |


## Shadow Control Maps
Textures that dictate the fixed shadows of the material.

### 1st Shading Position Map
Specifies the position of fixed shadows that fall in 1st shade color areas in UV coordinates. **1st Position Map**: Texture(linear).

### 2nd Shading Position Map
Specifies the position of fixed shadows that fall in 2nd shade color areas in UV coordinates. **2nd Position Map**: Texture(linear).


<br><br>
## Example of Shadow Control Map Application
| Base Map | 1st Shading Map | Shading Position Map |
| ---- | ---- | ---- |
| <img alt="A UV map texture that contains all the parts of a chibi-style character model." src="images/utc_all2_light.png" height="256"> |<img alt="The same UV map but some areas have a darker color." src="images/utc_all2_dark.png" height="256"> |<img alt="A mostly white texture, with 3 black hair shapes." src="images/utc_all2_offsetdark.png" height="256"> |

No Shadow Control Maps:

## Emission Map
Primarily used with the Bloom Post Effect and represents luminous objects.

![The Unity logo against a transparent background. The color fades from bright white at the center to black at the edges. The texture dimensions are 1024 x 1024, the texture size is 1.3MB, and the texture type is RBGA Compressed DXT5|BC3 UNorm.](images/EmissionMapSample.png)

## Emission Map Animation
When enabled, the UV and color of the **Emission Map** animate.

<video title="A cube with the Unity logo on each face. The logo loops through the color spectrum, and vertical black bars scroll horizontally across the face." src="images/EmissionAnimation.mp4" width="auto" height="auto" autoplay="true" loop="true" controls></video>


### Base Speed (Time)
Specifies the base update speed of scroll animation. If the value is 1, it will scroll in 1 second. Specifying a value of 2 results in twice the speed of a value of 1, so it will scroll in 0.5 seconds.

Base Speed = 0.5:

<video title="A cube with a pink Unity logo on each face. Vertical black bars scroll horizontally across each face." src="images/EmissionMapBaseSpeedHalf.mp4" width="auto" height="auto" autoplay="true" loop="true" controls></video>

Base Speed = 1.5:

<video title="The same cube. The black bars scroll faster." src="images/EmissionMapBaseSpeedOneAndHalf.mp4" width="auto" height="auto" autoplay="true" loop="true" controls></video>

### Animation Mode
Controls the animated scrolling of the emissive texture.

UV Coordinate Scroll:

<video title="A cube with a pink Unity logo on each face. Vertical black bars scroll horizontally across each face." src="images/EmissionMapBaseSpeedHalf.mp4" width="auto" height="auto" autoplay="true" loop="true" controls></video>

View Coordinate Scroll:

<video title="The same cube. A black horizontal wipe effect occurs across the left and front faces." src="images/EmissionMapViewCoordinateScroll.mp4" width="auto" height="auto" autoplay="true" loop="true" controls></video>

### Scroll U/X direction
Specifies how much the Emissive texture should scroll in the U-direction (x-axis direction) when updating the animation. Base Speed (Time) x Scroll U Direction x Scroll V Direction determine the animation speed.

### Scroll V/Y direction
Specifies how much the Emissive texture should scroll in the V-direction (y-axis direction) when updating the animation. Base Speed (Time) x Scroll U Direction x Scroll V Direction determine the animation speed.

### Rotate around UV center
When Base Speed=1, the Emissive texture will rotate clockwise by 1. When combined with scrolling, rotation will occur after scrolling.

<video title="A cube with the Unity logo on each face. The logo is visible through black bars that rotate." src="images/RotateAroundUVCenter3.mp4" width="auto" height="auto" autoplay="true" loop="true" controls></video>

### Ping-pong moves for base
When enabled, you can set PingPong (back and forth) in the direction of the animation.

<video title="A cube with a pink Unity logo on each face. Vertical black bars scroll back-and-forth horizontally across each face." src="images/PingPongMove.mp4" width="auto" height="auto" autoplay="true" loop="true" controls></video>

### Color Shifting with Time
The color multiplied by the Emissive texture changes by linear interpolation (Lerp) toward the Destination Color.

#### Destination Color
Target color for [Color Shifting with Time](#color-shifting-with-time), must be in HDR.

#### Color Shifting Speed (Time)
Sets the reference speed for color shift. When the value is 1, one cycle should take around 6 seconds.

<video title="A cube with the Unity logo on each face. The logo loops through the color spectrum, and vertical black bars scroll horizontally across the face." src="images/ColorShiftingWithTime.mp4" width="auto" height="auto" autoplay="true" loop="true" controls></video>

### Color Shifting with View Angle
Emissive color shifts consistent with view angle. The further out from the front of the camera, the more it changes to [Shifting Target Color](#shifting-target-color).

#### Shifting Target Color
Target color for [Color Shifting with View Angle](#color-shifting-with-view-angle) which must be in HDR.

<video title="A cube with the Unity logo on each face. Vertical black bars scroll horizontally across the face. The front face is pink and the left and lower faces are purple." src="images/ColorShiftingWithView.mp4" width="auto" height="auto" autoplay="true" loop="true" controls></video>

## HDRP Box Light

In HDRP, [only one directional light can cast shadow at a time](https://docs.unity3d.com/Manual/render-pipelines-feature-comparison.html).
This can be undesirable when we need lighting that differs from the scene's main directional light,
such as brightening a character's face or adding idealized shadows.

The [Box Light](https://docs.unity3d.com/Packages/com.unity.render-pipelines.high-definition@14.0/manual/Light-Component.html#Shape)
offers a practical workaround, and Unity Toon Shader supports it.
<canvas class="image-comparison" role="img" aria-label="The Scene view with a cube representing a box light, and the Game view with a chibi-style character model. When the box light is rotated, the shadows on the face of the model change.">

# Highlight Settings

The ability to display specular highlights in a cel-animation-like manner is essential for toon shaders. The **Unity Toon Shader** provides a wide variety of expressions with controllable illumination that works independently of light color and intensity for impressive cel-shading.

Settings:
* [Highlight](#highlight)
* [Highlight Power](#highlight-power)
* [Specular Mode](#specular-mode)
  * [Color Blending Mode](#color-blending-mode)
* [Highlight Blending on Shadows](#highlight-blending-on-shadows)
  * [Blending Level](#blending-level)
* [Highlight Mask](#highlight-mask)
* [Highlight Mask Level](#highlight-mask-level)


## Highlight
Highlight: Texture(sRGB) × Color(RGB). Defines the pattern and tint of the specular highlight.

Default: white.

<canvas class="image-comparison" role="img" aria-label="A toon-shaded sphere in a room textured with graphs. The sphere has green and purple bands of color, and a bright white specular highlight. Then the same sphere, with the color picker window open and the color #FF0000 selected. The specular highlight on the sphere is now orange and yellow.">
    <img src="images/Highlight0.png" title="The default color.">
    <img src="images/Highlight1.png" title="A different light color applied.">
</canvas>
<br />Drag the slider to compare the images.

## Highlight Power

The highlight size is controlled by the **Highlight Power** slider. 

<video title="Tweaking the highlight power." src="images/SpecularPower.mp4" width="auto" height="auto" autoplay="true" loop="true" controls></video>


## Specular Mode

UTS provides two modes for the highlight for different occasions and effect. The hard mode provides a crisp and solid edge to the highlight while the soft mode provides a blended blurred effect.

<canvas class="image-comparison" role="img" aria-label="A close-up of a white specular highlight on a green sphere. The highlight is a clear white disc with a hard edge. Then the same close-up. The specular highlight is now a blurred white disc.">
    <img src="images/SpecularHard.png" title="Mode: Hard.">
    <img src="images/SpecularSoft.png" title="Mode: Soft.">
</canvas>
<br />Drag the slider to compare the images.

<br><br>

### Color Blending Mode
Specular color blending mode allows the user to control the hardness of the colour applied to the highlight. 
Users have two options: Multiply or Add.

Note that **Color Blending Mode** is disabled when **Specular** Mode is set to **Soft**.

<canvas class="image-comparison" role="img" aria-label="A close-up of a yellow specular highlight on a green sphere. The highlight is a clear yellow disc with a hard edge. Then the same close-up. The specular highlight is now a blurred yellow disc.">
    <img src="images/SpecularMultiply.png" title="Multiply">
    <img src="images/SpecularAdd.png" title="Add">
</canvas>
<br />Drag the slider to compare the images.

## Highlight Blending on Shadows
Control the blending for the highlights in shadows. Please refer to the image at [Blending Level](#blending-level).

### Blending Level
Adjusts the intensity of highlight applied to shadow areas.

<video title="A specular highlight on a green sphere. Part of the highlight is in shadow, and fades in and out." src="images/HighlightBlendingLevel.mp4" width="auto" height="auto" autoplay="true" loop="true" controls></video>

## Highlight Mask
A gray scale texture which utilises its brightness to control highlight intensity. Applying the highlight mask allows to fine-tune the reflectivity on the material.

<canvas class="image-comparison" role="img" aria-label="A toon-shaded sphere in a room textured with graphs.

# Known Issues
## When using AOV Image Sequence Recorder

The **Unity Toon Shader** [Outline](Outline.md) is not automatically disabled when recording with the [AOV Image Sequence Recorder](https://docs.unity3d.com/Packages/com.unity.recorder@4.0/manual/RecorderAOV.html). Please disable [Outline](Outline.md#outline) in the Material Inspector when outputting AOV images.

## When using Universal Render Pipeline

When using the [Universal Render Pipeline](https://docs.unity3d.com/Manual/com.unity.render-pipelines.universal.html), you need to set [Depth Priming Mode](https://docs.unity3d.com/Packages/com.unity.render-pipelines.universal@16.0/manual/urp-universal-renderer.html#rendering) to **Disabled** to show the [outline](Outline.md).

<canvas class="image-comparison" role="img" aria-label="A chibi-style character model, and the Inspector window for the Univeral Renderer Data asset. On the left, Depth Priming is set to Auto and the model has no outline. When Depth Priming is set to Disabled, the model has an outline.">

Stabilize Camera Rolling enabled.


## Normal Map Specular Mask for MatCap

When enabled, uses a dedicated normal map for MatCap.
If MatCap is used as specular lighting, this normal map can serve as a specular mask.

<canvas class="image-comparison" role="img" aria-label="A view from above a chibi-style character model with blonde hair and brighter yellow specular highlights. Then the same view. The individual hairs now have highlights. ">

    <img src="images/MatCapNormalMapOn.png" title="Normal Map Specular Mask enabled">
</canvas>
<br />Drag the slider to compare the images.

### Normal Map
A texture that dictates the bumpiness of the material.

## MatCap Blending on Shadows
Enables the blending rate of the MatCap range in shadows.

<canvas class="image-comparison" role="img" aria-label="A view from above a chibi-style character model with blonde hair. With MatCap Blending on Shadows on, the bright highlights on individual hairs are less visible.">

    <img src="images/MatCapBlendingOnShadowOn.png" title="MapCap Blending on Shadows enabled.">
</canvas>
<br />Drag the slider to compare the images.


## Blending Level
Adjusts the intensity of MatCap applied to shadow areas.

<video title="Adjusts the intensity of MatCap applied to shadow areas." src="images/MatCapOnShadowLevel.mp4" width="auto" height="auto" autoplay="true" loop="true" controls></video><br/>


## MatCap Camera Mode
Control how the MatCap Map is rendered based on the camera type.

## MatCap Mask

The MatCap mask aligns with the mesh’s UVs used for the MatCap projection. 
Pixels in black (0) regions of the mask are fully hidden.

## MatCap Mask Level
Adjusts the level of the MatCap Mask. When the value is: 
* 1: MatCap represents 100% irrespective of mask. 
* -1: MatCap won't be displayed at all and MatCap will be the same as in the off state.

# Material Converter

## Capability

**Unity Toon Shader Material Converter** handles not only the **Unity Toon Shader** materials, but also [Unity-chan Toon Shader materials](https://github.com/unity3d-jp/UnityChanToonShaderVer2_Project) and [Univeral Toon Shader materials](https://github.com/unity3d-jp/UnityChanToonShaderVer2_Project/tree/release/urp/2.5.1).


Note: Unity-Chan Toon Shader materials saved with older than 2.0.6 have to be re-saved using 2.0.7 or newer.

## How to convert
All you have to do to convert toon shader materials to the **Unity Toon Shader materials** are:
* [Launch converter](#launching-converter)
* [Select render pipeline and shaders in your project](#selecting-the-converter)
* [Press **Scan** button](#pressing-scan-button).
* [Press **Convert** button](#pressing-convert-button).

Please make sure to back up the project since this converting process is irreversible.

## Launching Converter
Launch the converter from menu.
Window -> Rendering -> Unity Toon Shader Converter

   ![MaterialConverterMenu](images/MaterialConverterMenu.png)

Here is the converter screen.

   ![ConverterScreen](images/ConverterScreen.png)

## Selecting the converter
You see five options to convert materials in the project. Choose the shader used in the project.

   ![MaterialConverterMenu](images/ConverterWindowOption.png)


## Pressing Scan Button

   ![MaterialConverterScanButton](images/ConverterScanButton.png)

If you choose **Unity-chan Toon Shader 2** and the materials are saved with older than 2.0.6. The converter shows errors. In such case, you should save the materials using **Unity-chan Toon Shader** 2.0.7 or later.

   ![MaterialConverterScanButton](images/ConverterError.png)

## Pressing Convert Button

If there is no error, just press convert button.

# Entities Graphics URP Samples Project
This Project includes feature sample Scenes for URP Entities Graphics.

## Feature sample Scenes
The feature sample Scenes are in the _SampleScenes_ folder split into different folders depending on topic. Most of these Scenes include GameObjects in a SubScene.

Unity renders GameObjects with Entities Graphics when a corresponding entity exists, and without Entities Graphics when a corresponding entity does not exist. For the GameObjects in the SubScene, this means that Unity renders them with Entities Graphics at all times; in Edit Mode, in Play Mode, and in the built player.
