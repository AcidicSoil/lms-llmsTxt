## Frequently asked questions

### Which endpoint should I bind to?

The endpoint you should bind to varies between clients and servers and depends on the services your game uses. For example, if you’re using [Unity Relay](https://unity.com/products/relay), all communication goes through the Relay servers, so there’s no need to use a known port.

**For clients**:

Clients usually shouldn't call the `Bind` method. The default behavior is to automatically bind to an [ephemeral port](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ephemeral_port) when connecting, which is the desired behavior 99% of the time.

The only time a client might bind to a particular endpoint is if a firewall requires the client to use a specific source port. This requirement of clients is uncommon and typically only seen in restrictive corporate environments.

**For servers**:

Servers typically bind to a wildcard IP address (for IPv4, it's `0.0.0.0` and for IPv6, it's `::1`) and a ephemeral port number. Here's an example of binding to port `7777`:

```cs
driver.Bind(NetworkEndpoint.AnyIpv4.WithPort(7777));
```

The only reason you might want to bind to a specific IP address (instead of the wildcard address) is if your server has multiple interfaces and you want to limit clients to connect only through a particular one. You might want to do this for security reasons or if another service is already listening on the same port on a different interface.

**When using Relay**:

When using [Unity Relay](https://unity.com/products/relay), there is no real need to use a known port because all communications go through the Relay servers. In this situation, the recommended best practice is to bind to an ephemeral port for clients and servers. Check out the following code sample:

```cs
driver.Bind(NetworkEndpoint.AnyIpv4);
```

### Why is `Bind` returning an error?

`NetworkDriver.Bind` returns an error (a negative value) in the following cases:

- If the socket has creation fails
- If the socket fails to bind to its endpoint

There are many reasons for either of these cases. Here are the most common reasons:

1. The endpoint doesn't exist on the local machine. This is common when binding to a public IP address on a machine behind a LAN (local area network). Refer to the earlier question about which endpoint to bind to.
2. The port is already used by another service. You can use the `netstat` command line utility to diagnose this. For example, on Windows use the command `netstat -a -p UDP` to list UDP endpoints already in use.
3. Binding to a port lower than `1024`. On some platforms (for example, Linux), this requires elevated privileges.
4. Your user doesn't have the permission to create sockets. Some platforms will disallow the creation of sockets for restricted users. For example, on Android the application might require [extra permissions](https://docs.unity3d.com/2022.2/Documentation/Manual/android-permissions-in-unity.html).

### Why isn't my client connecting?

Common causes for a client failing to connect:

1. Binding to an improper endpoint on the server (as in the earlier code sample).
2. The server's firewall has a bad configuration. Try disabling it. If it solves the issue, you can then add a proper exception to its configuration (don't leave it disabled!).
3. The client can't reach the server. You can use command line utilities like `ping` and `traceroute` (`tracert` on Windows) to test the reachability of another machine on the network. It's also possible to observe the traffic sent/received on a machine with tools like [Wireshark](https://www.wireshark.org/).

### How can I change the connection/disconnection timeouts?

You can change connection and disconnection timeouts through custom `NetworkSettings` when creating the NetworkDriver component:

```cs
var settings = new NetworkSettings();
settings.WithNetworkConfigParameters(
    connectTimeoutMS: 500,
    maxConnectAttempts: 10,
    disconnectTimeoutMS: 10000);

var driver = NetworkDriver.Create(settings);
```

This code creates a NetworkDriver where establishing a connection fails after five seconds (with a maximum of 10 attempts, every 500 milliseconds). It also closes connections after 10 seconds of inactivity. The defaults are respectively one minute (60 attempts every second) and 30 seconds.

### Why was my connection closed?

You can get the reason for a `Disconnect` event from the event's `DataStreamReader`:

```cs
var eventType = driver.PopEvent(out _, out var streamReader);
if (eventType == NetworkEvent.Type.Disconnect)
{
    var disconnectReason = streamReader.ReadByte();
}
```

The obtained value is from the `Error.DisconnectReason` enum and indicates the cause of the `Disconnect` event.

### What's the largest message I can send?

By default, the [MTU](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maximum_transmission_unit) limits the size of messages. The MTU limit ensures messages aren't larger than a single IP packet on most network configurations. Because different protocols and pipelines have different overhead, the size of the maximum payload that you can write to a `DataStreamWriter` might vary. There are two ways to get this value:

```cs
// 1. Directly by subtracting headers from the MTU.
var maxPayloadSize = NetworkParameterConstants.MTU - driver.MaxHeaderSize(pipeline);

// 2. By looking at the capacity of a DataStreamWriter.
driver.BeginSend(pipeline, connection, out var writer);
var maxPayloadSize = writer.Capacity;
driver.AbortSend(writer);
```

To send messages larger than that, use a pipeline with the `FragmentationPipelineStage`. Refer to the section on [using pipelines](./pipelines-usage.md) for more information.

### What does error `NetworkSendQueueFull` mean?

Both `BeginSend` and `EndSend` can return the error code `NetworkSendQueueFull` (value -5).

#### If returned by `BeginSend`

It means UTP couldn't get a buffer for the new message from the send queue. This might indicate that the send queue capacity is insufficient for the workload. You can increase the capacity when creating the NetworkDriver:

```cs
var settings = new NetworkSettings();
settings.WithNetworkConfigParameters(
    sendQueueCapacity: 256
    receiveQueueCapacity: 256);

var driver = NetworkDriver.Create(settings);
```

As the example code demonstrates, it's often a good idea to set the receive queue capacity to the same value. Failing to do so might add latency to the processing of packets, or even cause the packets to drop. This is because if the receive queue is full, newly received packets have to wait in OS (operating system) buffers for processing. If the OS buffers are full, new packets are dropped.

The default value for both send and receive queue capacity is 64. Increasing the values will result in increased memory usage (the impact is about 1500 bytes per unit of capacity).

#### If returned by `EndSend`

This can only happen when sending on a pipeline with a `ReliableSequencedPipelineStage`. It indicates that there already 32 reliable packets in flight, which is the maximum. Refer to the section on [using pipelines](./pipelines-usage.md) or to the question below for tips on how to deal with this situation.

### Can I increase the limit of 32 packets in flight for the reliable pipeline?

It's possible to increase it to 64. Visit the section on [using pipelines](./pipelines-usage.md) for details. Unfortunately, it's impossible to increase it further than that.

However, if your application has different streams of data that require reliability and sequencing, but the ordering of messages between the streams doesn't matter, then it's possible to somewhat circumvent the limit by creating multiple reliable pipelines. That's because the limit is both per connection and per pipeline.

For example, you can create a pipeline for RPCs and another one for chat messages:

```cs
var rpcPipeline = driver.CreatePipeline(typeof(ReliableSequencedPipelineStage));
var chatPipeline = driver.CreatePipeline(typeof(ReliableSequencedPipelineStage));
```

Each pipeline will have its own limit of 32/64 messages in flight. Ordering between the two pipelines isn't guaranteed. Sending a message on `rpcPipeline` and then sending a message on `chatPipeline` doesn't mean that the RPC will be delivered first.

title: Unity Transport 0.8.0
id: transport-0-8-0
---

The [Unity Transport](https://docs-multiplayer.unity3d.com/transport/0.8.0/) `com.unity.transport` package respository adds multiplayer and network features to your project. See the following changelog for new features, updates, fixes, and upgrade information.

## [0.8.0] - 2021-03-23

### New features
* Added overloads of `PopEvent` and `PopEventForConnection` which return the pipeline used as an out parameter.

### Fixes
* Fixed some compatility issues with tiny.
* Fixed a crash when sending messages slightly less than one MTU using the fragmentation pipeline.
* Fixed a bug causing `NetworkDriver.RemoteEndPoint` to return an invalid value when using the default network interface.

## [0.7.0] - 2021-02-05

### New features
* Added `DataStreamWriter.WriteRawbits` and `DataStreamWriter.ReadRawBits` for reading and writing raw bits from a data stream.

### Changes
* Optimized the `NetworkCompressionModel` to find buckets in constant time.
* Changed the error behavior of `DataStreamReader` to be consistent between the editor and players.

### Fixes
* Fixed a crash when receiving a packet with an invalid pipeline identifier.

## [0.6.0] - 2020-11-26

### New features
* An error handling pass has been made and `Error.StatusCode` have been added to indicate more specific errors.
* `Error.DisconnectReason` has been added, so when NetworkDriver.PopEvent returns a `NetworkEvent.Type.Disconnect` the reader returned has 1 byte of data indicating the reason.

### Changes
* The function signature for NetworkDriver.BeginSend has changed. It now returns an `int` value indicating if the function succeeded or not and the DataStreamWriter now instead is returned as a `out` parameter.
* The function signature for INetworkInterface.Initialize has changed. It now requires you to return an `int` value indicating if the function succeeded or not.
* The function signature for INetworkInterface.CreateInterfaceEndPoint has changed. It now requires you to return an `int` value indicating if the function succeeded or not, and NetworkInterfaceEndPoint is now returned as a `out` parameter.

### Fixes
* Fixed a potential crash when receiving a malformated packet.
* Fixed an issue where the DataStream can sometimes fail writing packet uints before the buffer was full.

### Upgrade guide
* `NetworkDriver.BeginSend` now returns an `int` indicating a `Error.StatusCode`, and the `DataStreamWriter` is passed as an `out` parameter.

## [0.5.0] - 2020-10-01

### Fixes
* Fixed display of ipv6 addresses as strings

## [0.4.1] - 2020-09-10
### New features
* Added `NetworkDriver.GetEventQueueSizeForConnection` which allows you to check how many pending events a connection has.

### Changes
### Fixes
* Fixed a compatibility isue with DOTS Runtime.

## [0.4.0-preview.3] - 2020-08-21

### New features
* Added a new fragmentation pipeline which allows you to send messages larger than one MTU. If the `FragmentationPipelineStage` is part of the pipeline you are trying to send with the `NetworkDriver` will allow a `requiredPayloadSize` larger than one MTU to be specified and split the message into multiple packages.

### Changes
* The methods to read and write strings in the `DataStreamReader`/`DataStreamWriter` have been changed to use `FixedString<N>` instead of `NativeString<N>`. The name of the methods have also changed from `ReadString` to `ReadFixedString64` - and similar changes for write and the packed version of the calls. The calls support `FixedString32`, `FixedString64`, `FixedString128`, `FixedString512` and `FixedString4096`.
* Minimum required Unity version has changed to 2020.1.2.

### Upgrade guide
The data stream methods for reading and writing strings have changed, they now take `FixedString64` instead of `NativeString64` and the names have changed as follows:

* `DataStreamReader.ReadString` -> `DataStreamReader.ReadFixedString64`
* `DataStreamReader.ReadPackedStringDelta` -> `DataStreamReader.ReadPackedFixedString64Delta`
* `DataStreamWriter.WriteString` -> `DataStreamWriter.WriteFixedString64`
* `DataStreamWriter.WritePackedStringDelta` -> `DataStreamWriter.WritePackedFixedString64Delta`

The transport now requires Unity 2020.1.2.

## [0.3.1-preview.4] - 2020-06-05

### Changes
* Added a new `requiredPayloadSize` parameter to `BeginSend`. The required size can't be larger than `NetworkParameterConstants.MTU`.
* Added errorcode parameter to a `network_set_nonblocking`, `network_set_send_buffer_size` and `network_set_receive_buffer_size` in `NativeBindings`.
* Additional APIs added to `NativeBindings`: `network_set_blocking`, `network_get_send_buffer_size`, `network_get_receive_buffer_size`, `network_set_receive_timeout`, `network_set_send_timeout`.
* Implemented `NetworkEndPoint.AddressAsString`.

### Fixes
* Fixed an issue in the reliable pipeline which would cause it to not recover if one end did not receive packages for a while.
* Fixed `NetworkInterfaceEndPoint` and `NetworkEndPoint` `GetHashCode` implementation.
* Fixed invalid use of strings when specifying the size of socket buffers in the native bindings.

## [0.3.0-preview.6] - 2020-02-24

### Changes
* Pipelines are now registered by calling `NetworkPipelineStageCollection.RegisterPipelineStage` before creating a `NetworkDriver`. The built-in pipelines don't require explicit registration. The interface for implementing pipelines has been changed to support this.
* NetworkDriver is no longer a generic type. You pass it an interface when creating the `NetworkDriver`, which means you can switch between backends without modifying all usage of the driver. There is a new `NetworkDriver.Create` which creates a driver with the default `NetworkInterface`. it's also possible to create a `new NetworkDriver` by passing a `NetworkInterface` instance as the first argument.
* `NetworkDriver.Send` is replaced by `BeginSend` and `EndSend`. This allows us to do less data copying when sending messages. The interface for implementing new network interfaces has been changed to support this.
* `DataStreamReader` and `DataStreamWriter` no longer owns any memory. They're just reading/writing the data of a `NativeArray<byte>`.
* `DataStreamWriter` has explicit types for all Write methods.
* `DataStreamReader.Context` has been removed.
* Error handling for `DataStreamWriter` has been improved, on failure it returns false and sets `DataStreamWriter.HasFailedWrites` to true. `DataStreamReader` returns a default value and sets `DataStreamReader.HasFailedReads` to true. `DataStreamReader` will throw an exception instead of returning a default value in the editor.
* IPCManager is no longer public, it's still possible to create a `NetworkDriver` with a `IPCNetworkInterface`.
* Added `NetworkDriver.ScheduleFlushSend` which must be called to guarantee that messages are send before next call to `NetworkDriver.ScheduleUpdate`.
* Added `NetworkDriver.LastUpdateTime` to get the update time the `NetworkDriver` used for the most recent update.
* Removed the IPC address family, use a IPv4 localhost address instead.

### Fixes
* Fixed a memory overflow in the reliability pipeline.
* Made the soaker report locale independent.

### Upgrade guide
Creation and type of `NetworkDriver` has changed, use `NetworkDriver.Create` or pass an instance of a `NetworkInterface` to the `NetworkDriver` constructor.

`NetworkDriver.Send` has been replaced by a pair of `NetworkDriver.BeginSend` and `NetworkDriver.EndSend`. Calling `BeginSend` will return a `DataStreamWriter` to which you write the data. The `DataStreamWriter` is then passed to `EndSend`.

All write calls in `DataStreamWriter` need an explicit type, for example `Write(0)` should be replaced by `WriteInt(0)`.

`DataStreamWriter` no longer shares current position between copies, if you call a method which writes you must pass it by ref for the modifications to apply.

`DataStreamWriter` no longer returns a DeferedWriter, you need to take a copy of the writer at the point you want to make modifications and use the copy to overwrite data later.

`DataStreamWriter` is no longer disposable. If you use the allocating constructor you need to use `Allocator.Temp`, if you pass a `NativeArray<byte>` to the constructor the `NativeArray` owns the memory.

`DataStreamReader.Context` no longer exists, you need to pass the `DataStreamReader` itself by ref if you read in a different function.

The interface for network pipelines has been changed.

The interface for network interfaces has been changed.

## [0.2.3-preview.0] - 2019-12-12
### Changes
* Added reading and write methods for NativeString64 to DataStream.

## [0.2.2-preview.2] - 2019-12-05

### Changes
* Added a stress test for parallel sending of data.
* Upgraded collections to 0.3.0.

### Fixes
* Fixed a race condition in IPCNetworkInterface.
* Changed NetworkEventQueue to use UnsafeList to get some type safety.
* Fixed an out-of-bounds access in the reliable sequenced pipeline.
* Fixed spelling and broken links in the documentation.

## [0.2.1-preview.1] - 2019-11-28

### Fixes
* Added missing bindings for Linux and Android.

## [0.2.0-preview.4] - 2019-11-26

### Changes
* Added support for unquantized floats to `DataStream` class.
* Added `NetworkConfigParameter.maxFrameTimeMS` so you to allow longer frame times when debugging to prevent disconnections due to timeout.
* Allow "1.1.1.1:1234" strings when parsing the IP string in the NetworkEndPoint class, it will use the port part when it's present.
* Reliable pipeline now doesn't require parameters passed in (uses default window size of 32)
* Added Read/Write of ulong to `DataStream`.
* Made it possible to get connection state from the parallel NetworkDriver.
* Added `LengthInBits` to the `DataStreamWriter`.

### Fixes
* Don't push data events to disconnected connections. Fixes an error about resetting the queue with pending messages.
* Made the endian checks in `DataStream` compatible with latest version of burst.

## [0.1.2-preview.1] - 2019-07-17

### New features
* Added a new *Ping-Multiplay* sample based on the *Ping* sample.
    * Created to be the main sample for demonstrating Multiplay compatibility and best practices (SQP usage, IP binding, etc.).
    * has both client and server code. Additional details in readme in `/Assets/Samples/Ping-Multiplay/`.
* **DedicatedServerConfig**: Added arguments for `-fps` and `-timeout`.
* **NetworkEndPoint**: Added a `TryParse()` method which returns false if parsing fails
    * Note: The `Parse()` method returns a default IP / Endpoint if parsing fails, but a method that can report failure was needed for the Multiplay sample.
* **CommandLine**:
    * Added a `HasArgument()` method which returns true if an argument is present.
    * Added a `PrintArgsToLog()` method which is a simple way to print launch args to logs.
    * Added a `TryUpdateVariableWithArgValue()` method which updates a ref var only if an arg was found and successfully parsed.

### Changes
* Deleted existing SQP code and added reference to SQP Package (now in staging).
* Removed SQP server usage from basic *Ping* sample.
    * Note: The SQP server was only needed for Multiplay compatibility, so the addition of *Ping-Multiplay* allowed us to remove SQP from *Ping*.

### Fixes
* **DedicatedServerConfig**: Vsync is now disabled programmatically if requesting an FPS different from the current screen refresh rate.

## [0.1.1-preview.1] - 2019-06-05

### New features
* Moved MatchMaking to a package and supporting code to a separate folder.

### Fixes
* Fixed an issue with the reliable pipeline not resending when completely idle.

## [0.1.0-preview.1] - 2019-04-16

### New features
* Added network pipelines to enable processing of outgoing and incomming packets. The available pipeline stages are `ReliableSequencedPipelineStage` for reliable UDP messages and `SimulatorPipelineStage` for emulating network conditions such as high latency and packet loss. See the pipeline documentation for more information.
* Added reading and writing of packed signed and unsigned integers to `DataStream`. These new methods use huffman encoding to reduce the size of transfered data for small numbers.

### Changes
* Enable Burst compilation for most jobs.
* Made it possible to get the remote endpoint for a connection.
* Replacing EndPoint parsing with custom code to avoid having a dependency on `System.Net`.
* Change the ping sample command-line parameters for server to `-port` and `-query_port`.
* For matchmaking, use an Assignment object containing the `ConnectionString`, the `Roster`, and an `AssignmentError` string instead of just the `ConnectionString`.

### Fixes
* Fixed an issue with building iOS on Windows.
* Fixed inconsistent error handling between platforms when the network buffer is full.

### Upgrade guide
Unity 2019.1 is now required.

`BasicNetworkDriver` has been renamed to `GenericNetworkDriver` and a new `UdpNetworkDriver` helper class is also available.

`System.Net` EndPoints can no longer be used as addresses, use the new NetworkEndpoint struct instead.

The [Unity Transport](https://docs-multiplayer.unity3d.com/transport/1.0.0/about/) `com.unity.transport` package respository adds multiplayer and network features to your project. See the following changelog for new features, updates, fixes, and upgrade information.

## [1.0.0] - 2022-03-28

### Changes
* Changed version to 1.0.0.

## [1.0.0-pre.16] - 2022-03-24

### Changes
* Don't warn when overwriting settings in `NetworkSettings` (for example, when calling the same `WithFooParameters` method twice).
* Added new methods to set security parameters: `NetworkSettings.WithSecureClientParameters` and `NetworkSettings.WithSecureServerParameters`. These replace the existing `WithSecureParameters`, which is now obsolete.
* Updated Collections dependency to 1.2.3.

### Fixes
* Fixed client certificate not being passed to UnityTLS on secure connections. This prevented client authentication from properly working.
* Fixed: Reliable pipeline drop statistics inaccurate.

## [1.0.0-pre.15] - 2022-03-11

### Changes
* An error is now logged if failing to decrypt a DTLS message when using Relay.
* Decreased default Relay keep-alive period to 3 seconds (was 9 seconds). The value can still be configured through the `relayConnectionTimeMS` parameter of `NetworkSettings.WithRelayParameters`.

### Fixes
* Updated Relay sample to the most recent Relay SDK APIs (would fail to compile with latest packages).

## [1.0.0-pre.14] - 2022-03-01

### Changes
* `IValidatableNetworkParameter.Validate()` method is now part of `INetworkParameter`.
* Added: `NetworkDriver.Create<>()` generic methods.

### Fixes
* Fixed compilation on WebGL. Note that the platform is still unsupported, but at least including the package in a WebGL project won't create compilation errors anymore. Creating a `NetworkDriver` in WebGL projects will now produce a warning.

## [1.0.0-pre.13] - 2022-02-14

### New features
* When using the Relay protocol, error messages sent by the Relay server are now properly captured and logged.

### Fixes

* Fixed: Issue where an overflow of the `ReliableSequencedPipelineStage` sequence numbers would not be handled properly.

## [1.0.0-pre.12] - 2022-01-24

### Fixes
* Clean up changelog for package promotion.

## [1.0.0-pre.11] - 2022-01-24

### Changes
* Updated to Burst 1.6.4.
* Updated to Mathematics 1.2.5.
* Documentation has been moved to the offical multiplayer documentation site.

### Fixes
* Fixed a division by zero in `SimulatorPipelineStage` when `PacketDropInterval` is set.
* Don't warn when receiving repeated connection accept messages (case 1370591).
* Fixed an exception when receiving a data message from an unknown connection.

## [1.0.0-pre.10] - 2021-12-02

### Fixes
* On fragmented and reliable pipelines, sending a large packet when the reliable window was almost full can result in the packet being lost.
* Fixed "pending sends" warning being emitted often when sending to remote hosts.
* Revert decrease of MTU to 1384 on Xbox platforms (now back at 1400). It would cause issues for cross-platform communications.

## [1.0.0-pre.9] - 2021-11-26

### Changes
* Disabled Roslyn Analyzers provisionally

### Fixes
* Fixed: Compiler error due to Roslyn Analyzers causing a wrong compiler argument

## [1.0.0-pre.8] - 2021-11-18

### Changes
* Creating a pipeline with `FragmentationPipelineStage` _after_ `ReliableSequencedPipelineStage` is now forbidden (will throw an exception if collections checks are enabled). That order never worked properly to begin with. The reverse order is fully supported and is the recommended way to configure a reliable pipeline with support for large packets.
* Added `NetworkSettings` struct and API for defining network parameters.
* Added Roslyn Analyzers for ensuring proper extension of NetworkParameters and NetworkSettings API.
* Update Collections package to 1.1.0

### Fixes
* Fixed: Error message when scheduling an update on an unbound `NetworkDriver` (case 1370584)
* Fixed: `BeginSend` wouldn't return an error if the required payload size was larger than the supported payload size when close to the MTU
* Fixed: Removed boxing in `NetworkDriver` initialization by passing `NetworkSettings` parameter instead of `INetworkParameter[]`
* Fixed a crash on XboxOne(X/S) when using the fragmentation pipeline (case 1370473)

### Upgrade guide
* `INetworkPipelineStage` and `INetworkInterface` initialization methods now receive a `NetworkSettings` parameter instead of `INetworkParameter[]`.

## [1.0.0-pre.7] - 2021-10-21

### Changes
* Some public APIs that should have always been internal are now internal (`Base64`, `SHA256`, `HMACSHA256`, `NetworkEventQueue`, `UdpCHeader`, `UdpCProtocol`, `SessionIdToken`, `NativeMultiQueue`).

### Fixes
* Fixed: Cann't send a payload of the configured payload size on fragmented pipelines

## [1.0.0-pre.6] - 2021-10-14

### New features
* Added heartbeats functionality to all protocols (enabled by default). If there's no traffic on a connection for some time, a heartbeat is automatically sent to keep the connection alive. The inactivity timeout is controlled by the new parameter `heartbeatTimeoutMS` in `NetworkConfigParameter`. Setting it to 0 disables the feature.

### Changes
* Added `heartbeatTimeoutMS` in `NetworkConfigParameter` to support heartbeats (see above).
* `NetworkDriver.Bind` is now synchronous when using Relay (matches behavior of other protocols).
* `NetworkDriver.Bind` isn't required to be called anymore for Relay clients (only for host).
* `EndSend` will now return an error if called with a writer that has failed writes.
* MTU decreased to 1384 (from 1400) on Xbox platforms.
* `Connect` will automatically bind the driver if not already bound. This was already done implicitly before, but now it's explicit (the `NetworkDriver.Bound` property will be true after a successful call to `Connect`).
* Added `DataStream.ReadLong`

### Fixes
* Fixed: Receiving a Disconnect message on DTLS would crash the receive job
* Fixed: TLS server name might be set to nothing in Relay+DTLS, causing the handshake to fail
* Fixed: Cann't send large messages on fragmented pipeline if `requiredPayloadSize` wasn't provided to `BeginSend`
* Fixed: DTLS handshake messages were never resent if lost
* Fixed: Clients wouldn't honor the endpoint their were bound to

### Known issues
* Function pointers (for instance in `BeginSend` and `EndSend`) generate GC allocations in non-Burst use cases. The issue will be fixed in the next releases
* XboxOne(S/X) crash when using fragmentation pipeline when the size of the packet is within 100 bytes of the MTU. This will be fixed in the next release


## [1.0.0-pre.5] - 2021-09-16

### Fixes
* Fixed: Socket never created on unbound DTLS clients (causes handshake to fail)
* Fixed: When using DTLS it would not properly read data packets
* Fixed: When using DTLS it can possibly fail to send a packet that was at the MTU size.

## [1.0.0-pre.4] - 2021-09-07

### Fixes
* Fixed: Updated collection types in `SecureNetworkProtocol.cs`
* Fixed: Fixed race condition between UTP and Relay disconnects
* Fixed: Relay not being able to use the fragmentation pipelinestage

## [1.0.0-pre.3] - 2021-09-01

### New features
* Removed references of TransportSamples from readme as they're not currently included in the package
* Stripping out un-needed files from the package

## [1.0.0-pre.2] - 2021-08-23

### New features
* Upgraded collections to 1.0.0-pre.5
* Added support for Secure Protocol while using Unity Relay


## [1.0.0-pre.1] - 2021-07-29

### New features
* Moving into pre-release
* Added Secure Protocol support (TLS/DTLS) to allow for encrypted and secure connections.
* Unity Transport package now supports connecting to the Unity Relay Service. See [Unity Relay](https://unity.com/products/relay) for more information.
* Upgraded burst to 1.5.5


## [0.9.0] - 2021-05-10

### New features
* Added support for long serialization and delta compression.
* Upgraded collections to 1.0.0-pre.1
* Added a new network interface for WebSockets, can be used in both native and web builds.

### Changes
* Minimum required Unity version has changed to 2020.3.0f1.
* The transport package can be compiled with the tiny c# profile and for WebGL, but WebGL builds only support IPC - not sockets.

id: transport-1-0-0

The [Unity Transport](https://docs-multiplayer.unity3d.com/transport/1.0.0/about/) `com.unity.transport` package respository adds multiplayer and network features to your project. See the following changelog for new features, updates, fixes, and upgrade information.

## [1.4.0] - 2023-06-28

### New features

* Added a new `GetUnsafeReadOnlyPtr` method to `DataStreamReader`. This is meant as an escape hatch for use cases that require passing stream readers outside of a job (this not possible with `DataStreamReader` directly since the safety system will not allow it). As the name implies, this throws away many safety guarantees and is thus not recommended to use unless absolutely required.

### Changes

* `NetworkDriver.GetRelayConnectionStatus` will now return the new enum value `RelayConnectionStatus.NotUsingRelay` when called on a `NetworkDriver` that has not been configured to use Unity Relay. The previous behavior was to throw an exception.
* It is now possible to configure the maximum message size that the transport will send through a new `maxMessageSize` parameter in `NetworkSettings.WithNetworkConfigParameters`. This is useful for environments where network equipment mishandles larger packets (like some mobile networks or VPNs). The value excludes IP and UDP headers, but includes headers added by the transport itself (e.g. reliability headers). The default value is 1400. Note that it is recommended that both client and server be configured to use the same value.

## [1.3.4] - 2023-04-27

### Fixes

- Fixed an issue where the reliable pipeline stage could end up writing past the end of its internal buffer and thrashing the buffers of other connections. This could result in packet corruption, but would most likely result in erroneous -7 (NetworkDriverParallelForErr) errors being reported when calling EndSend.
- Fixed an issue where upon returning -7 (NetworkDriverParallelForErr), EndSend would leak the send handle. Over time, this would result in less send handles being available, resulting in more -5 (NetworkSendQueueFull) errors.
- If nothing is received from a Unity Relay server for a while, the transport will now attempt to rebind to it. This should improve the accuracy of GetRelayConnectionStatus in scenarios where the Relay allocation times out while communications with the server are out.

## [1.3.3] - 2023-03-17

### Fixes

- Fixed an issue where calling ScheduleFlushSend before the socket was bound would still result in socket system calls being made, resulting in errors being logged.

## [1.3.2] - 2023-03-09

### Fixes

- Fixed issue where UWP Xbox builds were crashing because the split buffer fix was not including UWP defines.
- Fixed an issue where IPCNetworkInterface would perform useless work for each packet received.
- Fixed an issue where ReliableSequencedPipelineStage could end up duplicating packets when sending reliable packets while the send queue is full.

## [1.3.1] - 2022-12-09

### Changes

- It is now possible to set a window size of up to 64 for ReliableSequencedPipelineStage (use NetworkSettings.WithReliableStageParameters to modify the value). Doing so increases the packet header size by 4 bytes though, so the default value remains at 32.

### Fixes
- Fixed an issue where if one end of a reliable pipeline stopped sending any traffic and its latest ACK message was lost, then the other end would stall.
- Fixed a crash when using DTLS if an update was delayed for long enough that both the disconnection and heartbeat timeouts expire.

## [1.3.0] - 2022-09-27

### New features

* Added a way to obtain `RelayAllocationId`, `RelayConnectionData`, and `RelayHMACKey` structures from byte arrays using the static `FromByteArray` method.
* Added a new constructor for `RelayServerData` that is now provided with argument types that better match those available in the models returned by the [Relay SDK](https://docs.unity.com/relay/SDK/sdk.html). **Note**: We also updated the "RelayPing" sample to use the new constructor.
* Added new constructors for `RelayServerData` that are provided with argument types that better match those available in the models returned by the [Relay SDK](https://docs.unity.com/relay/SDK/sdk.html). **Note**: We also updated the "RelayPing" sample to use the new constructor.
* Updated `NetworkSettings` to include a `IsCreated` property that can be used to check if it's been disposed of or not.
* Added new versions of `NetworkSettings.WithSecureClientParameters` and `NetworkSettins.WithSecureServerParameters`. These new versions take strings as parameters instead of references to fixed strings. The older versions are still available and fully supported.
* Added a new version of `NetworkSettings.WithSecureClientParameters` that only takes the server name as a parameter. You can use this when the server uses certificates from a recognized CA (certificate authority).

### Changes

* Added a warning that triggers if binding to a port where another application is listening. The binding operation still succeeds in that scenario, but this will fail in Unity Transport 2.0 (which disables address reuse on the sockets used by the default interface).
* Deprecated the constructor for `RelayServerData` that was taking strings for the allocation ID, connection data, and key. Use the new constructor (see above) or the existing lower-level constructor instead.
* Deprecated the `RelayServerData.ComputeNewNonce` method. You can provide a custom nonce using the "low level" constructor of `RelayServerData`. The new constructor selects a new nonce automatically.
* Added the option to call `Connect` without an endpoint if you’re using [Relay](https://docs.unity.com/relay) (the endpoint would be ignored anyway). This extension to `NetworkDriver` is provided in the `Unity.Networking.Transport.Relay` namespace.

### Fixes

* Fixed a possible stack overflow error that occurs if the `receive` or `send` queue parameters are configured with large values (>15,000).
* Prevented an issue where a warning about having too many pipeline updates would be spammed after a connection was closed.
* Fixed an issue where a duplicated reliable packet wouldn't be processed correctly, which can possibly lead to the entire reliable pipeline stage stalling (not being able to send new packets).
* Fixed an issue where pipeline updates would be run too many times, which would waste CPU and can lead to the warning about having too many pipeline updates being erroneously logged.
* Fixed issues with `ReliableSequencePipelineStage` that would, in rare circumstances, lead to failure to deliver a reliable packet.

## [1.2.0] - 2022-08-16

### Fixes

* Fixed a lag issue with iOS when switching app from being in background to resuming use.

## [1.1.0] - 2022-06-14

### New features

* A `DataStreamReader` can now be passed to another job without triggering the job safety system.
* A `GetRelayConnectionStatus` method has been added to `NetworkDriver` to query the status of the connection to the Relay server.

### Changes

* `NetworkSettings.WithDataStreamParameters` is now obsolete. The functionality still works and will remain supported for version 1.X of the package, but will be removed in version 2.0. The reason for the removal is that in 2.0 the data stream size is always dynamically-sized to avoid out-of-memory errors.
* `NetworkSettings.WithPipelineParameters` is now obsolete. The functionality still works and will remain supported for version 1.X of the package, but will be removed in version 2.0, where pipeline buffer sizing is handled internally.
* Updated Burst dependency to 1.6.6.
* Updated Collections dependency to 1.2.4.
* Updated Mathematics dependency to 1.2.6.

### Fixes

* `BeginSend` would not return an error if called on a closed connection before the next `ScheduleUpdate` call.
* Fixed a warning if using the default maximum payload size with DTLS.
* Removed an error log when receiving messages on a closed DTLS connection (this scenario is common if there were in-flight messages at the moment of disconnection).
* Fix broken link in package documentation.

## [1.0.0] - 2022-03-28

### Changes

* Changed version to 1.0.0.

title: Unity Transport 2.0.0+
id: transport-2-0-0
---

The [Unity Transport](https://docs-multiplayer.unity3d.com/transport/current/about/) `com.unity.transport` package repository adds multiplayer and network features to your project. See the following changelog for new features, updates, fixes, and upgrade information.

## [2.2.1] - 2023-12-06

### Fixes

* Fixed an issue where `NetworkEndpoint.TryParse` would leave the out parameter endpoint with a valid `NetworkFamily`, even if parsing of the address had failed.

## [2.2.0] - 2023-12-01

### New features

* The WebSocket URL path can now be configured using `NetworkSettings.WithWebSocketParameters`. For clients, the path provided there is the path on which connections will be made. For servers, it's the path connections will be accepted on.
* It is now possible to specify a payload to be sent along with connection requests through a new parameter for the `NetworkDriver.Connect` call. This payload is retrievable as-is on the server side when calling `NetworkDriver.Accept`. An example usage would be to send an authentication token (thus alleviating the need to do this through a separate message).

### Changes

* All parameter structures that can be used with `NetworkSettings` are now marked as `Serializable`.
* For custom endpoints, `NetworkDriver.Connect` will now automatically bind to the endpoint passed as a parameter instead of binding to the wildcard IPv4 address (only if the driver was not previously bound).
* The size of `NetworkEndpoint` has been increased, which allows creating custom endpoints (endpoints where the family is `NetworkFamily.Custom`) containing up to 60 bytes of data.

### Fixes

* Allow creating a driver with the same Relay allocation as a previous driver. Note that having two drivers using the same Relay allocation _at the same time_ is not supported. This fix is for the case where one disposes of a driver, and then creates a new one with the same Relay allocation.
* Fixed an issue where some data messages could be inadvertently dropped if the last message in the connection handshake was lost in transit.
* Fixed an issue where reliable packets could be resent even after they had been acknowledged, which would lead to wasted bandwidth.
* Fixed an issue that made it impossible to set the family of a `NetworkEndpoint` to `NetworkFamily.Custom`.
* Fixed an issue where it was possible for the state of a connection (as reported by `GetConnectionState`) would be `Disconnected` one update before the `Disconnect` event would appear through `PopEvent`.
* Fixed an issue where WebSocket connections would be closed if the TCP OS buffers were overflowed. In this situation, traffic that can't be sent on the TCP socket will now accumulate in the send queue. If _that_ fills up, then new `BeginSend` operations will return `Error.StatusCode.NetworkSendQueueFull` and the situation can be handled by user as they see fit (e.g. buffer the traffic on the side). Frameworks like Netcode for GameObjects already handle this situation gracefully.
* Fixed an issue where if the receive queue was filled up (say when pulling a lot of data at once from a socket), then WebSocket packets would fail to be processed and their associated connections would be closed.

## [2.1.0] - 2023-09-19

### New features

* It is now possible to configure the maximum message size that the transport will send through a new `maxMessageSize` parameter in `NetworkSettings.WithNetworkConfigParameters`. This is useful for environments where network equipment mishandles larger packets (like some mobile networks or VPNs). The value excludes IP and UDP headers, but includes headers added by the transport itself (e.g. reliability headers). The default value is 1400. Note that it is recommended that both client and server be configured to use the same value.
* Added new values `AuthenticationFailure` and `ProtocolError` to the `Error.DisconnectReason` enum. These values are respectively returned when a connection fails to be established because of DTLS/TLS handshake failure, and for unexpected and unrecoverable errors encountered by the transport (e.g. unexpected socket errors or malformed WebSocket frames).
* Added a new `NetworkFamily.Custom` value and proper support for it in `NetworkEndpoint`. This value is intended for usage with custom `INetworkInterface` implementations, where endpoints are not IP addresses.

### Changes

* Updated Collections dependency to 2.2.1.
* Updated Burst dependency to 1.8.8.
* Updated Mathematics dependency to 1.3.1.
* `NetworkDriver.GetRelayConnectionStatus` will now return the new enum value `RelayConnectionStatus.NotUsingRelay` when called on a `NetworkDriver` that has not been configured to use Unity Relay. The previous behavior was to throw an exception. This can be used to safely determine if a driver is using Relay, even from Burst-compiled code.
* `RelayServerData` now exposes a `IsWebSocket` field that can be used to determine if the server data will be using a WebSocket endpoint. This value is set automatically if constructing the `RelayServerData` from an allocation object, and can be set through a new optional `isWebSocket` parameter for low-level constructors.
* `NetworkEndpoint.RawPort` is now obsolete. There is little use for this API since it basically only converts to/from network byte order. There are standard C# APIs to do this.

### Fixes

* Fixed a possible crash when using secure WebSockets that would occur if a connection was closed suddenly with pending packets waiting to be sent.
* Fixed an issue where empty messages would not properly be received if sent on a non-default pipeline.
* Fixed "Input string was not in a correct format" log when listening on a port already in use.

## [2.0.2] - 2023-05-30

### Changes

* When using Unity Relay, `NetworkDriver.GetRemoteEndpoint` will now always return the address of the Relay server, instead of returning the address until a connection is established, and then returning the allocation ID encoded as an endpoint (appearing as an invalid endpoint). This makes the behavior the same as it was in version 1.X of the package.
* Updated Collections dependency to 2.1.4.
* A warning will now be emitted if passing a connection type other than "wss" to the `RelayServerData` constructors on WebGL (other connection types are not supported on that platform).

### Fixes

* Fixed an issue where the reliable pipeline stage could end up writing past the end of its internal buffer and thrashing the buffers of other connections. This could result in packet corruption, but would most likely result in erroneous -7 (`NetworkDriverParallelForErr`) errors being reported when calling `EndSend`.
* Fixed an issue where upon returning -7 (`NetworkDriverParallelForErr`), `EndSend` would leak the send handle. Over time, this would result in less send handles being available, resulting in more -5 (`NetworkSendQueueFull`) errors.
* Fixed an issue where WebSocket connections would always take at least `connectTimeoutMS` milliseconds to be reported as established, even if the connection was actually established faster than that.
* Fixed an issue where `ArgumentOutOfRangeException` could be thrown in situations where a new WebSocket connection is established while a previous connection is in the process of being closed.
* If nothing is received from a Unity Relay server for a while, the transport will now attempt to rebind to it. This should improve the accuracy of `GetRelayConnectionStatus` in scenarios where the Relay allocation times out while communications with the server are out.
* Fixed an issue where `UDPNetworkInterface` (the default one) would not bind to the correct address if the local IP address change and the socket needs to be recreated (e.g. because the app was backgrounded on a mobile device).
* Fixed an issue where `Disconnect` events would fail to be reported correctly for WebSocket connections.
* Fixed an issue where, when using Relay, heartbeats would be sent constantly when they are disabled by setting `relayConnectionTimeMS` to 0 in the Relay parameters.

## [2.0.1] - 2023-04-17

### Changes

- Updated Collections dependency to 2.1.1.

## [2.0.0] - 2023-04-14

### Changes

- NetworkEndpoint.ToString and its fixed string variant now return "invalid" for invalid endpoints instead of an empty string.
- Updated Burst dependency to 1.8.4.
- Updated Collections dependency to 2.1.0.

### Fixes

- Fixed an issue where the TLS handshake of a new secure WebSocket connection could possibly fail if there were already other active connections on the same server.

## [2.0.0-pre.8] - 2023-03-30

### New features

- MultiNetworkDriver can then be used for client drivers too. The restriction on it accepting only listening drivers has been lifted, and it now offers a new Connect method to connect client drivers. This makes it easier to write networking code that can be shared between server and client.
- Added a new ReliableUtility.SetMaximumResendTime static method, allowing to modify the maximum resend time of the reliable pipeline at runtime (there's already a similar method for the minimum resend time). Increasing this value can improve bandwidth usage for poor connections (RTT greater than 200ms).
- Added the possibility of setting the minimum and maximum resend times of the reliable pipeline through NetworkSettings (with WithReliableStageParameters).

### Changes

- NetworkEndpoint.TryParse will now return false and log an error when attempting to parse an IPv6 address on platforms where IPv6 is not supported. The previous behavior was to throw an exception, but only in the editor. On the devices themselves, the address would be successfully parsed silently, which would lead to confusing socket errors down the line.
- The SimulatorUtility.Context structure has been made internal. It contained only implementation details, or values that appeared useful but were actually either misleading or broken.
- The RelayMessageType enum has been made internal. The only purpose of this type was to list the different messages of the Relay protocol, which is an implementation detail that should not be relevant to users.

### Fixes

- Fixed an issue where calling ScheduleFlushSend before the socket was bound would still result in socket system calls being made, resulting in errors being logged.
- No warning will be printed when attempting to send on a WebSocket connection that has been closed by the remote peer (would only happen if calling ScheduleFlushSend).

## [2.0.0-pre.7] - 2023-03-15

### New features

- Added a new MultiNetworkDriver API to make it easier to handle multiple NetworkDriver instances at the same time for cross-play scenarios. Refer to the "cross-play support" section of the documentation for more details on this feature. This new API is also showcased in a new "CrossPlay" package sample.

### Changes

- Update Burst dependency to 1.8.3.
- The QueuedSendMessage structure was removed as it didn't serve any purpose anymore.
- The dependency argument of NetworkDriver.ScheduleFlushSend is now optional.
- SequenceHelpers, RandomHelpers, and the extensions in NativeListExt and FixedStringExt have all been made internal. These are all internal helper classes that shouldn't have been part of the public API in the first place.
- Many APIs and types inside ReliableUtility have been made internal (among them all APIs and types dealing with send/receive contexts and packet information and timers). The information they contain was meant purely for internal consumption in the first place. The statistics and RTT information inside the shared context remains public.
- Removed errorCode from ReliableUtility.SharedContext. Any useful information it can provide is already returned by higher-level APIs like NetworkDriver.EndSend.
- Default send and receive queue sizes are now set to 512 packets (previous value was 64). The queue sizes are modifiable with NetworkSettings.WithNetworkConfigParameters.

### Fixes

- Fixed a possible exception in IPCNetworkInterface if it was fed an unknown endpoint.
- Fixed NetworkDriver.GetLocalEndpoint when using WebSocketNetworkInterface (note that on web browsers this will now print a warning since local endpoints are not available on WebGL).

## [2.0.0-pre.6] - 2023-01-13

### New features

- Added a NetworkConnection.ToFixedString method to allow logging network connections from Burst.

## [2.0.0-pre.5] - 2023-01-12

### Changes

- Revert to Collections 2.1.0-pre.6 as pre.7 is not promoted yet.

## [2.0.0-pre.4] - 2023-01-12

### Changes

- Update Burst dependency to 1.8.2.
- Update Collections dependency to 2.1.0-pre.7.
- The InternalId and Version properties of NetworkConnection are now internal. These referred to internal values and using them directly was error-prone since values could be reused across connections. To compare connections reliably, compare the NetworkConnection objects directly (they implement all the relevant operators and interfaces).
- Replace NetworkDriverIdentifierParameter (and WithNetworkDriverIdentifierParameters) with a more general LoggingParameter (and WithLoggingParameters). Note that currently these parameters don't affect anything, and are there for future use only.

## [2.0.0-pre.3] - 2022-11-29

### Changes

- it's now possible to set a window size of up to 64 for `ReliableSequencedPipelineStage` (use `NetworkSettings.WithReliableStageParameters` to modify the value). Doing so increases the packet header size by 4 bytes though, so the default value remains at 32.
- The Soaker and Pipeline samples were removed in an effort to streamline the samples offered with the package.

### Fixes

- Fixed an issue where following an IP address change, the connection to the Relay server would not be re-established properly because of a malformed bind message.
- Fixed an issue where connecting to a Relay server on WebGL builds would fail with a `SocketException`.
- Fixed an issue where an `InvalidOperationException` would be thrown when hosting on WebGL even if using Relay (the exception should only be thrown when not using Relay).

## [2.0.0-pre.2] - 2022-11-11

### Changes

- The return code of `NetworkDriver.Bind` and `NetworkDriver.Listen` is now a proper value from the `Error.StatusCode` enum, instead of a seemingly random negative value.
- If the connection to the Relay server fails (for example, the DTLS handshake fails), then the connection status returned by `NetworkDriver.GetRelayConnectionStatus` will now be `AllocationInvalid`. It used to remain `NotEstablished` which would leave no way for a user to determine that the connection had failed.
- Status codes `NetworkHeaderInvalid` and `NetworkArgumentMismatch` are now marked as obsolete. Nothing in the API returns these status codes anymore.

### Fixes

- Fixed `IndexOutOfRangeException` when connecting a driver configured with IPC interface and Relay. This case isn't valid and now fails with a `InvalidOperationException` when the driver is created.
- Fixed a crash on Android when using the Mono backend.

## [2.0.0-exp.8] - 2022-10-28

### New features

- Support for the `com.unity.logging` package has been added. If the package is installed, logs will go through its default logger instead of the classic `UnityEngine.Debug` mechanism.
- A new `FixedPEMString` type is introduced to store certificates and private keys in the PEM format. `WithSecureClientParameters` and `WithSecureServerParameters` from `NetworkSettings` now accept certificates and private keys in this format instead of `FixedString4096Bytes`. it's still recommended to use the `string`\-based versions, however.

### Changes

- It isn't necessary anymore to configure the hostname with `NetworkSettings.WithSecureClientParameters` when using secure WebSockets connections to the Relay server.
- Fields have been renamed in the `SecureNetworkProtocolParameter` structure: `Pem` is now `CACertificate`, `Rsa` is now `Certificate`, and `RsaKey` is now `PrivateKey`. Note that directly using this structure isn't recommended. `WithSecureClientParameters` and `WithSecureServerParameters` from `NetworkSettings` are the preferred ways of configuring encryption parameters.
- The `SecureNetworkProtocolParameter` structure now stores certificates and private keys as `FixedPEMString` instead of `FixedString4096Bytes`, which allows for certificates larger than 4KB.
- `NetworkSettings.WithSimulatorStageParameters` now provides default values for parameters `maxPacketSize` and `applyMode`. The defaults are respectively the MTU size, and to apply the simulator in both directions (send/receive).

### Fixes

- Fixed Websockets sending ping messages when the `HeartbeatsTimeout` parameter is disabled (set to `0`).
- Fixed an issue with secure WebSockets where a connection would fail to be established if the end of the TLS handshake and beginning of the WebSocket handshake arrived in the same message.
- it's now possible to pass certificates larger than 4KB to `WithSecureClientParameters` and `WithSecureServerParameters` from `NetworkSettings`.
- Fixed an issue where if one end of a reliable pipeline stopped sending any traffic and its latest ACK message was lost, then the other end would stall.

## [2.0.0-exp.7] - 2022-09-29

### New features

- it's now possible to obtain `RelayAllocationId`, `RelayConnectionData`, and `RelayHMACKey` structures from byte arrays using their static `FromByteArray` method.
- A new constructor for `RelayServerData` is now provided with argument types that better match those available in the models returned by the Relay SDK. The "RelayPing" sample has been updated to use this constructor.
- New constructors for `RelayServerData` are now provided with argument types that better match those available in the models returned by the Relay SDK. The "RelayPing" sample has been updated to use them constructor.
- `NetworkSettings` now has a `IsCreated` property which can be used to check if it's been disposed of or not.

### Changes

- Reverted the fix for the `SimulatorPipelineStage` always using the same random seed, reverting its behavior to always be deterministic. If non-determinism is desired, use a dynamic random seed (for example, `Stopwatch.GetTimestamp`).
- The default network interface (`UDPNetworkInterface`) does not enable address reuse anymore. This means `NetworkDriver.Bind` will now always fail if something else is listening on the same port, even if that something else is bound to a wildcard address and we are trying to bind to a specific one.
- Added: `NetworkDriverIdentifierParameter` struct and `NetworkSettings.WithDriverIdentifierParameters()` method that can be use to identify the NetworkDriver instances with a custom label. Currently this method serves no purpose, but might be used in future releases to make debugging easier.
- The `InitialEventQueueSize`, `InvalidConnectionId`, and `DriverDataStreamSize` fields were removed from `NetworkParameterConstants`. They all served no purpose anymore.
- If using Relay, it's now possible to call `Connect` without an endpoint (the endpoint would be ignored anyway). This extension to `NetworkDriver` is provided in the `Unity.Networking.Transport.Relay` namespace.
- The `RelayServerData.HMAC` field is now internal. There was no use to this being available publicly.
- The deprecated constructor for `RelayServerData` that was taking strings for the allocation ID, connection data, and key has been completely removed.
- The deprecated `RelayServerData.ComputeNewNonce` method has also been removed. One can provide a custom nonce using the "low level" constructor of `RelayServerData`. Other constructors will select a new one automatically.

### Fixes

- Fixed an issue where a duplicated reliable packet wouldn't be processed correctly, which can possibly lead to the entire reliable pipeline stage stalling (not being able to send new packets).
- Fixed an issue where a warning about having too many pipeline updates would be spammed after a connection was closed.
- Fixed an issue where pipeline updates would be run too many times, which would waste CPU and can lead to the warning about having too many pipeline updates being erroneously logged.
- Fixed issues with `ReliableSequencePipelineStage` that would, in rare circumstances, lead to failure to deliver a reliable packet.
- Fixed an issue where sending maximally-sized packets to the Relay when using DTLS would fail with an error about failing to encrypt the packet.
- Fixed an issue when using secure WebSockets where the stream would become corrupted, resulting in failure to decrypt packets (and eventually potentially a crash of the server).

## [2.0.0-exp.6] - 2022-09-02

### Fixes

- Fixed changelog.

## [2.0.0-exp.5] - 2022-09-01

### New features

- Preliminary WebSocket support. To have a `NetworkDriver` use WebSockets, create it with the appropriate network interface (for example, `NetworkDriver.Create(new WebSocketNetworkInterface())`). To enable TLS support, create the driver with `NetworkSettings` configured with `WithSecureClientParameters`/`WithSecureServerParameters` (on the client, only the hostname needs to be provided).
- `NetworkSettings.WithSecureClientParameters` and `NetworkSettings.WithSecureServerParameters` now have versions where the certificates and hostnames are provided as normal strings, instead of fixed strings.

### Changes

- `Protocol` field was removed from the `SecureNetworkProtocolParameter` structure. The protocol is now determined automatically from the network interface being used.
- Updated to Collections 2.1.0-exp.1
- `FragmentationPipelineStage.FragContext` was made internal as it's an internal implementation detail that serves no purpose being exposed publicly.
- Multiple APIs were removed or made internal in `ReliableUtility` (more than is practical to list here). These were all internal implementation details that served no purpose being exposed publicly. The only remaining public APIs in `ReliableUtility` are those used to gather statistics from a reliable pipeline (as demonstrated in the Soaker sample).
- All APIs except `Parameters` and `Context` in `SimulatorUtility` were made internal as they're implementation details that serve no purpose being exposed publicly.
- it's no longer possible to configure the read timeout in the secure parameters as values other than the default (0) were never properly supported.
- it's no longer possible to configure the handshake minimum/maximum timeouts in the secure parameters. These values are now derived from the `connectTimeoutMS` and `maxConnectAttempts` values configured with `NetworkSettings.WithNetworkConfigParameters`.
- Hostnames in secure parameters are now `FixedString512Bytes` instead of `FixedString32Bytes`, allowing any possibly hostname to be used instead of only short ones.
- `NetworkSendQueueHandle` was removed. It wasn't used for anything anymore (previously it was used for custom implementations of `INetworkInterface`).
- `NetworkInterfaceSendHandle` and `SendHandleFlags` were made internal. With the removal of `NetworkSendInterface`, these served no purpose anymore.
- `INetworkInterface.Initialize` now receives a `ref packetPadding` parameter that can be increased to reserve space for headers.
- `BaselibNetworkInterface` was renamed to `UDPNetworkInterface`.

### Fixes

- Fixed an issue where when sending data on a connection and closing that connection in the same update, the data message would not be sent properly.
- Fixed a stack overflow exception when send/receive queue capacity was set high (>10,000).
- Fixed an issue where `SimulatorPipelineStage` would always use the same seed for its random number generator.

### Upgrade guide

## [2.0.0-exp.4] - 2022-08-03

### New features

- A new global network simulator has been added, configurable through `NetworkSettings.WithNetworkSimulatorParameters` (settings can be modified at runtime with `NetworkDriver.ModifyNetworkSimulatorParameters`). Unlike `SimulatorPipelineStage`, it applies its parameters to *all* traffic (including control messages). Note that it's currently *much* less featureful than `SimulatorPipelineStage` (only supports dropping packets for now), so we still recommend using the latter for all network simulation.
- Added a new `NetworkDriver.ModifySimulatorStageParameters` API to modify the parameters of the `SimulatorPipelineStage` at runtime.
- `NetworkDriver` now exposes the `NetworkSettings` currently in use through the `CurrentSettings` property. These settings are read-only.
- To implement the above functionality, `NetworkSettings` now provides a `AsReadOnly` method that returns a read-only copy of the settings.

## [2.0.0-exp.3] - 2022-07-11

### New features

### Changes

- Updated to Burst 1.7.3.
- Changed: A call to `NetworkDriver.Disconnect` now requires a subsequent call to `NetworkDriver.Update` for the disconnect packet to be effectively sent (Previously `NetworkDriver.FlushSend` was enough).
- Changed: The protocol used to establish connections now supports protocol versioning. This should help keep compatibility for future releases, but unfortunately it's now incompatible with the protocol used in version 1.X.

### Fixes

### Upgrade guide

- For `NetworkDriver.FlushSend` calls that follows a call to `NetworkDriver.Disconnect`, change it to `NetworkDriver.Update`.
- The communication protocol used to establish connections has had a breaking change and is now incompatible with Unity Transport 1.X. Clients and servers will need to be updated at the same time to keep compatibility.

## [2.0.0-exp.2] - 2022-06-07

### New features

- Added a new version of `NetworkDriver.CreatePipeline` that takes a `NativeArray` of `NetworkPipelineStageId` as an argument. The old version taking an array of `Type` objects is still fully supported.

### Changes

- Removed: `NetworkSettings.WithDataStreamParameters` has been deleted. The data stream size (the only parameter this API controlled) is now always dynamically-sized to avoid out-of-memory errors.
- Removed: `NetworkSettings.WithPipelineParameters` has been deleted. Initial sizing of the pipeline buffers is now handled internally.
- Removed: `NetworkPipelineStageCollection` has been deleted. See upgrade guide below for details of how to replace its usages.
- Updated to Collections 2.0.0-pre.32.
- Updated to Burst 1.7.2.
- Removed: `NetworkDriver.LastUpdateTime` has been deleted. This value was an internal detail not meant to be consumed by users, and its time reference cann't be reliably related to typical C# timestamps.

### Fixes

- Removed an error log when receiving messages on a closed DTLS connection (this scenario is common if there were in-flight messages at the moment of disconnection).
- `BeginSend` would not return an error if called on a closed connection before the next `ScheduleUpdate` call.
- Fix broken link in package documentation.
- On iOS, recreate the socket used for communications when coming back from app suspension. This solves an issue where communications would fail after the app was in the background for a few seconds and iOS decided to reclaim its resources.

### Upgrade guide

- Registering custom pipeline stages is now done on a per-`NetworkDriver` basis rather than globally through `NetworkPipelineStageCollection`. Concretely, that means replacing calls to `NetworkPipelineStageCollection.RegisterPipelineStage` with calls to `NetworkDriver.RegisterPipelineStage` for each instance of `NetworkDriver` that will make use of the custom pipeline stage.
- `NetworkPipelineStageId` is now obtained through the static `NetworkPipelineStageId.Get` method, rather than with `NetworkPipelineStageCollection.GetStageId`. Updating only requires replacing calls like `NetworkPipelineStageCollection.GetStageId(typeof(Foo))` with `NetworkPipelineStageId.Get<Foo>()`.
- `NetworkDriver.LocalEndPoint` and `NetworkDriver.RemoteEndPoint` were renamed to `NetworkDriver.GetLocalEndpoint` and `NetworkDriver.RemoteEndpoint`, respectively. This should be updated automatically.
- `INetworkInterface.LocalEndPoint` has been renamed to `INetworkInterface.LocalEndpoint` for consistency with other usages of the term in the API. Since this is an interface property, it must be manually updated (see upgrade guide below).
- Custom implementations of `INetworkInterface` must now implement the `LocalEndpoint` property instead of `LocalEndPoint`. This is purely a change in naming, the behavior should remain the same as before.

## [2.0.0-exp.1] - 2022-04-29

### New features

- Added automatic device reconnection (enabled by default). This feature will attempt to re-establish the connection after some inactivity. This feature is intended to handle IP address changes on mobile devices. The inactivity timeout can be controlled by the new parameter `reconnectionTimeoutMS` in `NetworkConfigParameter`. Setting it to 0 disabled the feature.
- When using the Relay protocol, error messages sent by the Relay server are now properly captured and logged.
- `PacketsQueue` and `PacketProcessor` APIs were added for sending and operating over packets in the `INetworkInterface`.
- A `GetRelayConnectionStatus` method has been added to `NetworkDriver` to query the status of the connection to the Relay server.

### Changes

- Updated to Collections 2.0.0-pre.15
- Updated to Burst 1.7.1.
- Updated to Mathematics 1.2.6.
- Minimal Unity Editor version supported is now 2022.2.0a11.
- Added `NetworkSettings` struct and API for defining network parameters.
- Added `reconnectionTimeoutMS` in `NetworkConfigParameter` to support device reconnection (see above).
- Creating a pipeline with `FragmentationPipelineStage` *after* `ReliableSequencedPipelineStage` is now forbidden (will throw an exception if collections checks are enabled). That order never worked properly to begin with. The reverse order is fully supported and is the recommended way to configure a reliable pipeline with support for large packets.
- If collections checks are enabled, trying to create an IPv6 `NetworkEndPoint` will now throw an exception on consoles that don't support IPv6 (PS4, PS5, Switch).
- Documentation has been moved to the offical multiplayer documentation site.
- The `INetworkInterface.ScheduleSend()` method signature was modified to receive a `SendJobArguments` struct instead of a `NativeQueue`. A `PacketsQueue` parameter is passed in this new struct.
- `sendQueueCapacity` and `receiveQueueCapacity` parameters moved from `BaselibNetworkParameter` to `NetworkConfigParameter`.
- Removed: `BaselibNetworkParameter.maximumPayloadSize` isn't needed anymore as it's handled internally.
- Removed: `INetworkInterface.CreateSendInterface` isn't needed anymore, the send queue is managed internally by the `NetworkDriver`. Operations from the `INetworkInterface` must be done through the `ScheduleSend` and `ScheduleReceive` methods. This removes the need of function pointers which where casing GC allocations on `BeginSend`, `EndSend` and `AbortSend` when burst isn't enabled.
- Added: `SendJobArguments` and `ReceiveJobArguments` structs to pass arguments to the send and receive jobs of the `INetworkInterface`.
- Obsolete: `NetworkDriver` constructor is now obsolete, instead use `NetworkDriver.Create` methods. This improves burst compatibility as generic methods allows to know the INeworkInterface type at compilation time.
- Obsolete: `NetworkPacketReceiver` is now deprecated. Use the `ReceiveJobArguments.ReceiveQueue` and `PacketProcessor` instead.
- `NetworkDriver.LastUpdateTime` is now consistent across different copies of a driver. it's now also set by the job scheduled with `ScheduleUpdate`, so any job scheduled before it won't see the updated value. This also means the value won't be updated right after `ScheduleUpdate` returns (only once its jobs completes).
- An error is now logged if failing to decrypt a DTLS message when using Relay.
- Decreased default Relay keep-alive period to 3 seconds (was 9 seconds). The value can still be configured through the `relayConnectionTimeMS` parameter of `NetworkSettings.WithRelayParameters`.
- `NetworkDriver` now requires that the `INetworkInterface` provided is an unmanaged type. Managed `INetworkInterfaces` are still supported but are required to be wrapped into an unmanaged type: `myInterface.WrapToUnmanaged()`.
- Instantiating a `NetworkDriver` is now only supported through the `NetworkDriver.Create` methods.
- Don't warn when overwriting settings in `NetworkSettings` (for example, when calling the same `WithFooParameters` method twice).
- Added new methods to set security parameters: `NetworkSettings.WithSecureClientParameters` and `NetworkSettings.WithSecureServerParameters`. These replace the existing `WithSecureParameters`.
- `NetworkInterfaceEndPoint` usage replaced with `NetworkEndPoint`.
- Removed: `INetworkInterface.CreateInterfaceEndPoint` and `INetworkInterface.GetGenericEndPoint` removed as interfaces use now `NetworkEndPoint`.
- Renamed `NetworkEndPoint` to `NetworkEndpoint`. This should be automatically updated.

### Fixes

- Fixed: Error message when scheduling an update on an unbound `NetworkDriver` (case 1370584)
- Fixed: Removed boxing in `NetworkDriver` initialization by passing `NetworkSettings` parameter instead of `INetworkParameter[]`
- Fixed: `BeginSend` wouldn't return an error if the required payload size was larger than the supported payload size when close to the MTU
- Fixed: Issue where an overflow of the `ReliableSequencedPipelineStage` sequence numbers would not be handled properly.
- Updated Relay sample to the most recent Relay SDK APIs (would fail to compile with latest packages).
- Fixed client certificate not being passed to UnityTLS on secure connections. This prevented client authentication from properly working.
- Fixed: Reliable pipeline drop statistics inaccurate.

### Upgrade guide

- `INetworkPipelineStage` and `INetworkInterface` initialization methods now receive a `NetworkSettings` parameter instead of `INetworkParameter[]`.
- `SimulatorPipelineStageInSend` is no longer required and can be safely removed from your pipeline construction. To replace it, `SimulatorPipelineStage` now supports handling both sending and receiving via `ApplyMode.AllPackets`.
- On fragmented and reliable pipelines, sending a large packet when the reliable window was almost full can result in the packet being lost.
- Revert decrease of MTU to 1384 on Xbox platforms (now back at 1400). It would cause issues for cross-platform communications.
- For custom implementation of the `INetworkInterface`: Remove the `CreateSendInterface` and update the `ScheduleSend` and `ScheduleReceive` signature; to iterate over the send/receive queue use the `PacketsQueue[]` operator.
- Move the definition of the `sendQueueCapacity` and `receiveQueueCapacity` parameters from the `WithBaselibNetworkParameters()` to the `WithNetworkConfigParameters()`.
- Update all `new NetworkDriver()` usages to `NetworkDriver.Create()`.
- For custom implementations of `INetworkInterface` that are managed types, use the `INetworkInterface.WrapToUnmanaged()` configuring the `NetworkDriver`.
- For custom implementations of `INetworkInterface`: Remove `CreateInterfaceEndPoint` and `GetGenericEndPoint` implementations and update `NetworkInterfaceEndPoint` usages to `NetworkEndPoint`.

## A

### Age (Staleness)

Objects or data which hasn’t been transmitted in a long time becomes higher-priority, until the next time it's transmitted, at which time its priority returns to a lower value.

### Asymmetrical multiplayer

A type of gameplay in which players can have significantly different roles or abilities from each other; enough to provide a significantly different experience of the game. 

- **Soft Asymmetry:** Players have the same basic mechanics (such as movement and death), yet have different roles in the game.

- **Strong Asymmetry:** One player/team may have one gameplay experience (or be in softly asymmetric roles) while the other player/team play in a drastically different way, with different mechanics and/or a different type of objective.

## B

## C

###  Client 

Is a network client that connects an individual user to the server, used mainly in multiplayer video games. It collects data such as score, player status, position and movement from a single player and sends it to the  server, which allows the server to collect each individual's data and show every player in game.

### Client Runtime

Is the active software and instructions executed while your applications are running on your local client. This includes mobile devices and desktop computers using a client application.

## D

## E

### Errors

Sometimes packets are corrupted due to bit errors caused by noise and interference, especially in wireless communications and long copper wires. The receiver has to detect this, and, just as if the packet was dropped, may ask for this information to be retransmitted.

## F

## G

### Gameplay Relevance
See also *[Spatial Relevance](#spatial-relevance)*
- **Interaction:** Have I, or am I likely about to, interact with a gameplay element. For example, a grenade I threw far away.
- **Objective:** Critical gameplay elements which need constant awareness. For example, a player carrying a flag across the map in CTF.

### Goodput

Due to varying load from disparate users sharing the same network resources, the maximum throughput that can be provided to a certain data stream may be too low for real-time multimedia services.

## H

### Hit Registration

This is how a shooter determines if your shot hit something. There are two main forms of hit registration.

:::note
There are more than just two cases. The non physics version of bullets via raycast is often also used for weapons with travel time such as snipers. Parabolas of bullets can be calculated without the need of a physics simulation.
:::

1. Games where bullet travel time isn't a factor in close quarters combat can use a simple and fast form where bullets have no travel time. 

1. Games where you need more complex and demanding bullet physics simulations for hit registration. Every projectile has a travel speed and trajectory, affected by various factors.

Hit registration can be done by your game client (client side), which then tells the server (or in p2p, the other clients) that you hit something. 

## I

### Interaction

Similar to interaction as it relates to Relevancy, objects which you have recently, or are about to interact with should typically be treated as higher priority to keep more frequent updates/synchronization.

Many things can happen to packets as they travel from origin to destination, resulting in the following problems as seen from the point of view of the sender and receiver:
See *[Goodput](#goodput)*, *[Packet loss](#packet-loss)*, *[Errors](#errors)*, *[Latency](../learn/dealing-with-latency.md)*, *[Packet delay variation](#packet-delay-variation)*, [Out-of-order delivery](#out-of-order-delivery)*

### Interactive Connectivity Establishment (ICE) 

*ICE* is a technique used in computer networking to find ways for two computers to talk to each other as directly as possible in peer-to-peer networking. This is most commonly used for interactive media such as Voice over Internet Protocol (VoIP), peer-to-peer communications, video, and instant messaging.

### IP address 

An Internet Protocol address is a numerical label assigned to each device connected to a computer network that uses the Internet Protocol for communication. An IP address serves two main functions: host or network interface identification and location addressing.

## J

## K

## L

## M

## N

### Netcode

Is a blanket term for anything that somehow relates to networking in online games; netcode is a term most commonly used by gamers when discussing synchronization issues between clients and servers.

### Network address translation (NAT) 

*Network address translation (NAT)* is a method of mapping an *IP address* space into another by modifying network address information in the IP header of packets while they're in transit across a traffic routing device.

### Networking Transport Layer

The transport layer collects message segments from applications, and transmits them into the network. The transport layer is also responsible for the management of error correction, providing quality and reliability to the end user.

This layer enables the host to send and receive error corrected data, packets or messages over a network

## O

### Out-of-order delivery

When a collection of related packets is routed through a network, different packets may take different routes, each resulting in a different delay. The result is that the packets arrive in a different order than they were sent. This problem requires special additional protocols for rearranging out-of-order packets. The reordering process requires additional buffering at the receiver, and, as with packet delay variation, increases the overall latency for the stream.

## P

### Packet

Packets are composed of a header and payload. 

- The **header** consists of fixed and optional fields. 
- The **payload** is the data that is carried on behalf of an application

The payload appears immediately after the header.

### Packet delay variation

Packets from the source will reach the destination with different delays. A packet's delay varies with its position in the queues of the routers along the path between source and destination, and this position can vary unpredictably. Delay variation can be absorbed at the receiver, but in so doing increases the overall latency for the stream.

### Packet loss

The network may fail to deliver (drop) some packets due to network congestion. The receiving application may ask for this information to be retransmitted, possibly resulting in congestive collapse or unacceptable delays in the overall transmission.

### Port 

A network port is a process-specific or an application-specific software construct serving as a communication endpoint, which is used by the Transport Layer protocols of Internet Protocol suite, such as User Diagram Protocol (UDP) and Transmission Control Protocol (TCP)

## Q

## R

### Reliable User Datagram Protocol (RUDP)

Reliable User Datagram Protocol (RUDP) provides a solution where UDP is too primitive because guaranteed-order packet delivery is desirable, but TCP adds too much complexity and overhead. It provides real-time, reliability and algorithm simplicity of embedded systems, both requirements for RCP and UDP. In order for RUDP to gain higher quality of service, RUDP implements features that are similar to TCP with less overhead.

### Routing

A data packet travels at a more or less fixed speed, so a player's ping is directly affected by the distance between the player and the server. However, the copper and fiber optic cables don't take a direct path to the data center, so the path, or route, to a data center that's physically farther away can actually end up being shorter than a route a data center that's physically closer to you.

Another factor that affects the data travel time is the number of stops (or hops) that your data packet must make on its way. Every additional hop also increases the risk that you lose a data packet.

## S

###  Server 

Is a server which is the authoritative source of events in a multiplayer video game. The server transmits enough data about its internal state to allow its connected clients to keep their own accurate version of the game world for display to players. They also receive and process each player's input

### Server Runtime

Is the active software and instructions executed while your applications are running on your server. This includes physical and virtual servers running hosted services and software communicating with additional services and clients.

### Session Traversal Utilities for NAT (STUN)

*STUN* is a tool for communications protocols to detect and traverse network address translators that are located in the path between two endpoints of communication. it's implemented as a light-weight client-server protocol, requiring only simple query and response components with a third-party server located on the common, easily accessible network, typically the Internet.

The basic protocol operates essentially as follows: The client, typically operating inside a private network, sends a binding request to a *STUN* server on the public Internet. The STUN server responds with a success response that has the IP address and port number of the client, as observed from the server's perspective. 

*STUN* messages are sent in *User Datagram Protocol (UDP)* packets. Since UDP does not provide reliable transport guarantees, reliability is achieved by application-controlled retransmissions of the *STUN* requests. *STUN* servers don't implement any reliability mechanism for their responses. When reliability is mandatory, the *Transmission Control Protocol (TCP)* may be used, but induces extra networking overhead

### Socket

A socket is one endpoint of a two-way communication link between two programs running on the network. A socket is bound to a port number so that the TCP layer can identify the application that data is destined to be sent to. An endpoint is a combination of an IP address and a port number.

### Spatial Relevance
See also: *[Gameplay Relevance](#gameplay-relevance)*
- **Distance from player:** How many units away is this object from the networked player
- **Static Zones:** Predefined areas of a game world, where a player typically only finds objects within their same zone or adjacent zones as relevant. Examples would be a room, building, or town.
- **View Frustum:** If it's in the camera’s view it’s relevant. If it's behind me, it isn't.
- **Instances:** Static zones which can be instantiated/copied multiple times. Example would be a dungeon raid.

## T

### Transmission Control Protocol (TCP)

Transmission Control Protocol (TCP) is a connection-oriented communications protocol that facilitates the exchange of messages between computing devices in a network. it's the most common protocol in networks that use the Internet Protocol (IP); together they're sometimes referred to as TCP/IP.

TCP takes messages from an application/server and divides them into packets, which can then be forwarded by the devices in the network – switches, routers, security gateways – to the destination. TCP numbers each packet and reassembles them before handing them off to the application/server recipient. Because it's connection-oriented, it ensures a connection is established and maintained until the exchange between the application/servers sending and receiving the message is complete.

## U

### User Datagram Protocol (UDP)

User Datagram Protocol (UDP) uses a simple connectionless communication model with a minimum of protocol mechanisms. UDP provides checksums for data integrity, and port numbers for addressing different functions at the source and destination of the datagram. It has no handshaking dialogues, and thus exposes the user's program to any unreliability of the underlying network; there is no guarantee of delivery, ordering, or duplicate protection. 

UDP is suitable for purposes where error checking and correction are either not necessary or are performed in the application; UDP avoids the overhead of such processing in the protocol stack. Time-sensitive applications often use UDP because dropping packets is preferable to waiting for packets delayed due to retransmission, which may not be an option in a real-time system.

### UDP hole punching

*UDP hole punching* is a commonly used technique employed in *Network Address Translation (NAT)* applications for maintaining *User Datagram Protocol (UDP)* packet streams that traverse the *NAT*. NAT traversal techniques are typically required for client-to-client networking applications on the Internet involving hosts connected in private networks, especially in peer-to-peer, Direct Client-to-Client (DCC) and Voice over Internet Protocol (VoIP) deployments.

UDP hole punching establishes connectivity between two hosts communicating across one or more network address translators. Typically, third-party hosts on the public transit network are used to establish UDP port states that may be used for direct communications between the communicating hosts. Once port state has been successfully established and the hosts are communicating, port state may be maintained either by normal communications traffic, or in the prolonged absence thereof, by keep-alive packets, usually consisting of empty UDP packets or packets with minimal non-intrusive content.

title: About Multiplayer Play Mode
description: Overview of Multiplayer Play Mode
---

Use Multiplayer Play Mode to test multiplayer functionality within the Unity Editor. You can simulate up to four Players (the main Editor Player and three Virtual Players) at the same time, on the same development device while using the same source assets on disk. Multiplayer Play Mode can help you create multiplayer development workflows that reduce project build times, run it locally, and test the server-client relationship.

## Compatibility

Multiplayer Play Mode version 1.5.0 is compatible with the following: 

* Unity Editor versions 6000.1.0b1 or later.
* Windows and MacOS platforms.
* Experimental Android support for Unity Editor version 6.1.

## Multiplayer Play Mode terminology

The following have specific meaning in relation to Multiplayer Play Mode:

* main Editor Player: The original instance of the project in the Unity Editor. This is the only instance with full authoring capabilities.
* Virtual Players: Simulated Players created with Multiplayer Play Mode. These Players open in a separate window with limited authoring capabilities when you enter [Play mode](https://docs.unity3d.com/Manual/GameView.html).
* Players: All Player instances, including the main Editor Player and all Virtual Players.

## Limitations

Multiplayer Play Mode has some inherent technical limitations, specifically around [scale](#scale) and [authoring](#authoring).

### Scale

The Unity Editor and Virtual Players require a lot of system resources, so you shouldn't use Multiplayer Play Mode at scale. Multiplayer Play Mode is designed for small-scale, local testing environments that can only support up to four total Players (the main Editor Player and three Virtual Players).

### Authoring
You can't create or change the properties of GameObjects in a Virtual Player. Instead, use the main Editor Player to make changes and a Virtual Player to test multiplayer functionality. Any changes you make in Play Mode in the main Editor Player reset when you exit Play Mode.
:::note
You can't access any main Editor Player functionality from Virtual Players.
:::

## Performance impact

To reduce the demand on system resources caused by each Virtual Player instance, Multiplayer Play Mode shares specific resources, such as the artifact database and imports between the main Editor Player and each Virtual Player.

title: Synchronize with Play mode
description: Understand how Multiplayer Play Mode synchronizes with Play mode for multiplayer testing.
---

Multiplayer Play Mode syncs the main Editor Player and [Virtual Players](../virtual-players) when you enter [Play Mode](https://docs.unity3d.com/Manual/GameView.html) in the Unity Editor. You control Multiplayer Play Mode the same way you control Play Mode with the Toolbar buttons.

| Toolbar Button | Function |
| --- | --- |
| **Play** | Runs all activated Players (main Editor Player and Virtual Players) |
| **Pause** | Pauses all activated Players (main Editor Player and Virtual Players) |
| **Step** | Performs a single-frame step for all activated Players (main Editor Player and Virtual Players) |

You can change the layout of the **Multiplayer Play Mode** window with the **Layout** dropdown. To learn more, refer to [Change the layout of a Virtual Player](virtual-players-layout).

:::note
If you enable Error Pause in the [Console](https://docs.unity3d.com/Manual/Console.html) toolbar of any Player, all Virtual Players pause when you call `Debug.LogError` from a script.

Use the Test Runner included in the [Unity Test Framework (UTF)](https://docs.unity3d.com/Packages/com.unity.test-framework@2.0/manual/index.html) to test players in a multiplayer project.

:::note: 
Multiplayer Play Mode version 1.1.0 is compatible with Unity Editor versions 6000.0.3f1 or later. Multiplayer Play mode versions 1.0.0 and earlier are compatible with Unity version 2023.1 or later.
:::

## Test a player
To open the Test Runner window go to **Window** > **General** > **Test Runner**.

To learn how to run a test in Unity, refer to [Running Play Mode tests in a player](https://docs.unity3d.com/Packages/com.unity.test-framework@2.0/manual/workflow-run-playmode-test-standalone.html).

When you run a test with Multiplayer Play Mode installed the test runner indicates which player passed or failed a test. To learn more about test results in the test runner, use the [TestStatus enum](https://docs.unity3d.com/Packages/com.unity.test-framework@2.0/api/UnityEditor.TestTools.TestRunner.Api.TestStatus.html).

To test one or more instances of a multiplayer project on a local device or a remote server, use the Play Mode Scenarios window. This window replicates the circumstances of a project that multiple users access from different environments that have different limitations.
You can use Play Mode Scenarios to test multiplayer gameplay on different platforms at the same time. 

## Compatibility

Play Mode Scenarios supports the following platforms: 

* Windows
* Linux
* MacOS
* Android

description: Learn how to set up and run instances in the Play Mode Scenario window.
---

When you set up a Play Mode Scenario, you can create the following type of instances: 

* Editor
* Local
* Remote

## Configure and build a remote instance

A remote instance exists in the [Unity Cloud](https://docs.unity.com/cloud/en-us) and uses [Unity Gaming Services (UGS) Multiplay Hosting](https://docs.unity.com/ugs/en-us/manual/game-server-hosting/manual/welcome-to-multiplay).

You can only have one remote instance in a Play Mode Scenario and it can only run on a Linux platform.

To learn more about the properties that you can use to configure a remote instance, refer to [Play Mode Scenarios window reference](mppm-reference/play-mode-scenario-window-reference.md).

:::tip Multiplay Hosting cost
You can start using Multiplay Hosting for free, but it can cost money to use a server even when it's not running a process or hosting any users. To reduce cost in a project that uses Multiplay Hosting, open the [Unity Cloud Dashboard](http://cloud.unity.com/) and reduce the **Minimum Available Scaling** property value to 0. To learn more about Multiplay Hosting pricing, refer to [UGS pricing](https://unity.com/products/gaming-services/pricing).
:::

## Configure and build a local instance
A local instance can run on the same platform as the Unity Editor, or on an Android device that is connected to that platform wirelessly or by a USB cable. To build a local instance that you have configured in the Play Mode Scenarios window, [enter Play Mode](https://docs.unity3d.com/Manual/GameView.html). All configured Play Mode Scenarios build automatically when you enter Play Mode.

To learn more about the properties that you can use to configure a local instance, refer to [Play Mode Scenarios window reference](mppm-reference/play-mode-scenario-window-reference.md).

## Check the status of all instances
The Play Mode status window displays the following information for each Play Mode Scenario:
* Status
* Port
* Address
* Errors

To open the Play Mode status window: 

1. Enter Play Mode.
2. Expand the Play Mode status dropdown.
3. Select the status window icon.

title: Hierarchy Network Debug View
---

The Hierarchy Network Debug View allows you to visually identify ownership of networked objects in your Unity project.

## Requirements

* Unity Editor version 6 or later.
* Multiplayer Tools package version 2.2.1 or later.

## Using the Hierarchy Network Debug View

You can enable the Hierarchy Network Debug View by navigating to **Window** > **Multiplayer Tools** and selecting **Enable** next to it in the list of tools.

When enabled, it provides an overlay on the right-hand side of your **Hierarchy** window that identifies which objects are networked (with a small network cube logo).

When you enter Play mode it also shows who owns the object (client ID), and whether the current client has ownership of this object (purple crown over network logo). This overlay can be particularly useful when working on [distributed authority](https://docs-multiplayer.unity3d.com/netcode/current/terms-concepts/distributed-authority/) multiplayer projects.

![Screenshot of the Hierarchy Network Debug View enabled](/img/tools/HierarchyOverlayOn.png)

You can also use the Hierarchy Network Debug View in conjunction with the [Network Scene Visualization tool](network-scene-viz.md).

![Screenshot of the Hierarchy Network Debug View enabled with Network Scene Visualization tool](/img/tools/HierarchyOverlayAndNetSceneVis.png)

Network Scene Visualization (NetSceneVis) is a powerful, user-friendly tool included in the Multiplayer Tools package to help you visualize and debug network communication on a per-object basis in the Unity Editor Scene View of your project with visualizations such as mesh shading and text overlay.

The NetSceneVis tool listens to network messages about the game state to visually display bandwidth and ownership on a per-object basis in the Unity Editor. The visualizations are updated in real-time as the network messages are sent and received, showing the game state synchronization across the network.

This tool can help you optimize and debug your network code to ensure that your game runs smoothly for all players.

## Requirements

- Unity 2023.2.0a11 or higher
- Multiplayer Tools package 2.0.0-pre.2 or higher, see [Install the Multiplayer Tools Package](./install-tools.md)

## Using Network Scene Visualization

After [installing the Multiplayer Tools package](#requirements), the Network Visualization toolbar is available in the scene view of the Unity Editor. This toolbar includes the options to visualize networking information per-object of your game.

![Screenshot of the Network Scene Visualization toolbar in the scene view of the Unity Editor](/img/tools/netscenevis-1.png)

Hovering over each option under **Bandwidth**, **Ownership**, and **Settings** reveals detailed tooltips for each option.

### Bandwidth

Selecting **Bandwidth Mode** displays the bandwidth usage of each object.

| Option | Description |
|---|---|
| *Type* | Filter the bandwidth by type: network variables (**NetVars**), **RPCs**, or **All**. **All** includes spawn, despawn, ownership change, network variables, and RPCs. |
| *Direction* | Filter bandwith by direction: **Sent**, **Received**, or **Sent and Received**. |
| *Smoothing* | Smooth the bandwidth data over time. Higher values improve readability by filtering out sudden data changes. This option is disabled when paused. |
| *Text Overlay* | Visualize the per-object bandwith with text labels. |
| *Shading* > *Auto Scale* | Automatically scales the mesh shading visualization to the current maximum per-object bandwidth of any object in the scene. The minimum bandwidth will always be 0. |
| *Shading* > *Min/Max Bandwidth Bar* | When **Auto Scale** is unchecked, you can manually choose the min and max bandwidth values. The color bar can be changed between 4 options. The color bar can be changed when **Auto Scale** is checked or unchecked. |

### Ownership

Selecting **Ownership Mode** displays the ownership of each object, either by the server, host, or by a specific client.

| Option | Description |
|---|---|
| *Text Overlay* | Visualize the per-object ownership with text labels. |
| *Shading* | Visualize the per-object ownership with a colored overlay. |

### **MeshShading** settings

These settings are only available when **MeshShading** is enabled.

You can toggle the **Outline** option to display a black outline around networked objects to improve visibility in the scene and distinguish between overlapping networked objects.

The **Saturation (%)** controls the saturation of non-networked objects so networked objects can stand out more. The scale goes from 0 as grayscale to 100 for full color.

### Custom colors

You can assign custom colors to servers or clients in your visualization by clicking on the color field you want to change. Any custom colors you assign are saved with your project and can be reset using the right-click context menu.

Custom colors also synchronize across [Multiplayer Play Mode](https://docs-multiplayer.unity3d.com/mppm/current/about/) players when in Play mode.

title: Network Simulator
sidebar_label: Network Simulator
---

The Network Simulator tool allows you to test your multiplayer game in less-than-ideal network conditions, enabling you to discover issues in simulated real-world scenarios and fix them before they surface in production. It facilitates simulating [network events](#network-events), such as network [disconnects](#disconnects), [lag spikes](#lag-spikes), and [packet loss](#packet-loss).

The tool exposes configurable network parameters, such as packet delay and packet loss, that allow you to control the network conditions. It also bundles common configurations of those parameters together as [presets](#network-configuration-presets).

You can use the Network Simulator component to test different network conditions and create custom network scenarios. These utilities include:

* [Disabling the network connection](#disconnects)
* Triggering a [lag spike](#lag-spikes)
* Changing the current [configuration preset](#network-configuration-presets)

You can also use the Network Simulator SDK to create custom network scenarios that can automatically trigger network events (such as a lag spike) at specific frequencies and intervals. To help you get started, it includes several [example network scenarios](#use-a-network-scenario).

:::note
**Note**: All parameters exposed through the Network Simulator tool work with the Unity Transport Protocol (UTP) simulator pipeline stage.
:::

## Requirements

The only requirement for using Network Simulator is Unity Editor version 2022.2 and later and the following [package dependencies](#package-dependencies).

### Package dependencies

|**Dependency**|**Version**|**Package name**|
|---|---|---|
|Unity Transport|2.0.0 or later|com.unity.transport >=  2.0.0|
|Netcode for GameObjects|1.1.0 or later|com.unity.netcode.gameobjects >= 1.1.0|

## Get started

To get started with the Network Simulator:

1. Add the following packages:
    1. Multiplayer Tools 1.1.0 or later
    2. Network for GameObjects 1.1.0 or later
    3. Unity Transport 2.0.0 or later
2. Add the NetworkSimulator Component to any GameObject that persists across scenes.

### Trigger a network disconnect

You can trigger a network disconnect in the Unity Editor with the Network Simulator component by setting the **Connection** to **Disconnected**. See the [Disconnect scenario](#disconnect-scenario) example.

![](/img/tools/netsim-1.png)

### Trigger a lag spike

You can trigger a simulated lag spike in the Unity Editor with the Network Simulator component by setting the **Duration of the lag spike (ms)**, then selecting **Trigger**.

![](/img/tools/netsim-7.png)

:::tip
You can trigger lag spikes through code with the `NetworkSimulator.TriggerLagSpike` API or you can write a Network Scenario that triggers it.  See the [Lag spike scenario](#lag-spike-scenario) example to learn how.
:::

### Use a Network Simulator Preset

The Network Simulator tool comes packaged with configuration presets that simulate common network conditions, such as a home broadband connection or a mobile 3G connection. To use one of the configuration presets:

1. Select the **NetworkSimulator** component from the **Hierarchy** tab.
2. Set the **Connection Preset** field to the configuration you want to use.

![](/img/tools/netsim-3.png)

### Create a Network Simulator Preset

The Network Simulator tool allows you to create any number of custom network configuration presets. To create a custom network configuration preset:

1. Right-click on the **Assets** folder in the **Project** tab.
2. Select **Create** > **Multiplayer** > **NetworkSimulatorPresetAsset**.
3. Select the NetworkSimulatorPreset from the **Assets** folder.
4. Edit the parameters in the **Inspector** tab. The parameters allow you to set the name, description, packet delay, packet jitter, and packet loss (as a percentage and interval).

![](/img/tools/netsim-11.png)

To use a custom Network Simulator Preset:

1. In the **Inspector** tab, set the **Connection Preset** to **Custom**.
2. Set the **Custom Preset** field to the preset asset you created.

Once you select the custom preset asset, you can edit it live from the Inspector tab by adjusting the parameters.

#### Use a Network Scenario

The Network Simulator tool supports NetworkScenarios. A NetworkScenario is a way to script how you want to affect the network conditions at runtime. They allow you to change parameters and presets dynamically.

It comes packaged with a couple network scenarios presets, such as the [Connections Cycle](#connections-cycle) and [Random Connections Swap](#random-connections-swap).

:::note
You can also [create custom network scenarios](#create-a-network-simulator-preset).
:::

To use a network scenario:

1. Select the **NetworkSimulator** component from the **Hierarchy** tab.
2. Under Network Scenarios in the Inspector tab, set the **Scenario** field to the network scenario you want to use.

![](/img/tools/netsim-12.png)

:::tip
You can control whether the Network Scenario runs automatically by toggling the **Auto Run Scenario** checkbox. You can also set this option dynamically via code.

![](/img/tools/netsim-2.png)
:::

#### Connections Cycle

The **Connections Cycle** Network Scenario allows you to cycle through different network conditions at specific intervals. By default, it includes one cycle that’s set to None. To configure the Connection Cycle:

1. From the Inspector tab, expand the **Network Scenarios** > **Configurations** section.

![](/img/tools/netsim-15.png)

1. Set the first **Connection Preset** to a built-in preset or a custom preset.

![](/img/tools/netsim-13.png)

1. Set the **Change Interval Milliseconds** field to the time to wait before switching to the next preset.

![](/img/tools/netsim-8.png)

1. Select the **plus (+)** symbol to add another cycle.

![](/img/tools/netsim-14.png)

1. Configure the next cycle as you see fit.

![](/img/tools/netsim-4.png)

The Connections Cycle scenario cycles through the configurations list at the **Change Interval** until you use the **Pause** button to pause the connection cycling.

#### Random Connections Swap

The **Random Connections Swap** Network Scenario allows you to specify a set of network configuration presets to swap through at random. By default, it includes one cycle that’s set to None. To configure the Random Connection Swap:

1. From the Inspector tab, expand the **Network Scenarios** > **Configurations** section.

![](/img/tools/netsim-6.png)

1. Set the **Class Preset** to a built-in preset or a custom preset.

![](/img/tools/netsim-10.png)

1. Select the **plus (+)** symbol to add another configuration.

![](/img/tools/netsim-5.png)

1. Configure the configuration as you see fit.

![](/img/tools/netsim-9.png)

The Random Connections Swap scenario selects one of configurations from the list at random at the **Change Interval** until you use the **Pause** button to pause the connection cycling.

## Network types

A network type is the general state of a user’s network connection. This section has the descriptions of the available Network Simulator preset configurations. These configuration presets fall into five categories:

* [Home broadband connections](#home-broadband-connections)
* [Poor quality mobile connections](#poor-quality-mobile-connections)
* [Medium quality mobile connections](#medium-quality-mobile-connections)
* [Decent quality mobile connections](#decent-quality-mobile-connections)
* [Good quality mobile connections](#good-quality-mobile-connections)

### Home broadband connections

A home broadband connection presets represent common connections from desktops, console platforms, and some mobile devices. Most of them are good quality network connections.

* [Home Broadband](#home-broadband)
* [Home Fiber](#home-fiber)
* [Home Cable](#home-cable)
* [Home DSL](#home-dsl)
* [Home Satellite](#home-satellite)
* [Home Broadband with Congested Network](#home-broadband-with-congested-network)

### Poor-quality mobile connections

A poor-quality mobile connection preset represents an extremely poor connection, entirely unsuitable for synchronous multiplayer gaming due to exceptionally [high ping](#latency). However, it might work for some turn-based games.

The following Network Simulator presets simulate a poor-quality mobile connection:

* [Mobile 2G](#mobile-2g)
* [Mobile 2.5G](#mobile-25g)
* [Mobile 2.75G](#mobile-275g)
* [Mobile 3G](#mobile-3g)

### Medium-quality mobile connections

A medium-quality mobile connection preset represents the minimum supported mobile connection for synchronous gameplay. Expect [high pings](#latency), [jitter](#jitter), stuttering, and [packet loss](#packet-loss).

The [Mobile 3.5G](#mobile-35g) Network Simulator presets simulates a medium-quality mobile connection.

### Decent-quality mobile connections

A decent-quality mobile connection preset represents a suitable network for synchronous multiplayer. However, the [ping](#latency) and overall connection quality and stability might result in poor player experience due to [packet drops](#packet-loss). Players might drop all packets in bursts of one to 60 seconds, so you must ensure you handle reconnections.

The following Network Simulator presets simulate a poor quality mobile connection:

* [Mobile 3.75G](#mobile-375g)
* [Mobile 4G](#mobile-4g)
* [Mobile 4.5G](#mobile-45g)

### Good quality mobile connections

A good quality mobile connection preset represents a mobile connection comparable to or better than a typical [home broadband connection](#home-broadband).

The [Mobile 5G](#mobile-5g) Network Simulator preset simulates a good-quality mobile connection

## Network events

The following sections cover common network connection events and problems you can simulate with the Network Simulator.

* [Disconnects](#disconnects)
* [Lag spikes](#lag-spikes)
* [Latency](#latency)
* [Packet loss](#packet-loss)
* [Jitter](#jitter)
* [Instability](#instability)

### Disconnects

A network disconnect is a disruption or termination of the connection between the sender and the receiver.

You can trigger a network disconnect in the Unity Editor with the Network Simulator component by setting the **Connection** to **Disconnected**. See the [Disconnect scenario](#disconnect-scenario) example.

![](/img/tools/netsim-1.png)

### Lag spikes

A lag spike refers to a temporary increase in network latency. Some of the most common causes of lag spikes include overburdened CPUs, temporary network disconnects, and unreliable connections with high [jitter](#jitter).

You can trigger a simulated lag spike in the Unity Editor with the Network Simulator component by setting the **Duration of the lag spike (ms)**, then selecting **Trigger**. See the [Lag spike scenario](#lag-spike-scenario) example.

![](/img/tools/netsim-7.png)

### Latency

Network latency measures the time it takes a packet to travel across a network in milliseconds (ms). Players experience high latency (sometimes called “lag”) when the time delay between the server (or host) sending the information and the client receiving the information creates communication bottlenecks or an undesirable playing experience.

You can trigger control the simulated network latency in the Unity Editor with the Network Simulator component by setting the **Packet Delay (ms)** parameter.

:::note
A common method of measuring the latency of a network connection is through ping messages. Pings are small network packets that you can use to measure the time it takes a packet to reach its destination in milliseconds. High ping often equates to high latency.
:::

### Packet loss

Packet loss occurs when packets fail to reach their destination when transmitted across a network. It’s typically measured as a percentage of packets lost or the frequency of packets dropped.

You can trigger control the simulated packet loss in the Unity Editor with the Network Simulator component by setting the **Packet Loss Interval** and the **Packet Loss (%)** parameters.

### Jitter

Jitter is the variation in packet delays ([latency](#latency)) measured in milliseconds (ms). High-quality network connections typically have reliable and consistent latency. However, poorer-quality network connections experience high variations in latency, which can create an inconsistent or poor experience for players. These high variations in latency can cause issues such as flickering displays, stuttering, further packet delays, and additional CPU usage.

You can trigger control the simulated network jitter in the Unity Editor with the Network Simulator component by setting the **Packet Jitter (ms)** parameter.

### Instability

An unstable network connection might consist of intermittent network issues, such as network [disconnects](#disconnects), [packet loss](#packet-loss), [jitter](#jitter), and [latency](#latency).

See the [Unstable connection scenario](#unstable-connection-scenario) example.

## Network scenarios

Network scenarios are built-in (or custom) presets for network types that simulate a specific scenario, such as intermittent lag spikes. They allow you simulate a variable combination of issues and automatically switching configuration presets.

You can use the Network Simulator SDK to create custom network scenarios that automatically trigger network events (such as a lag spike) at specific frequencies and intervals.

The code samples in this section showcase how you can build custom network simulator scenarios.

### Lag spike scenario

The following code snippet shows using `NetworkScenarioTask` to create a custom network scenario that simulates a connection with [lag spikes](#lag-spikes). See [`LagSpikeScenarioWithAsyncTask.cs`](https://github.com/Unity-Technologies/com.unity.multiplayer.tools/blob/develop/Samples~/NetworkSimulator/LagSpikeScenarioWithAsyncTask.cs#L27).

### Disconnect scenario

The following code snippet uses `NetworkScenarioBehaviour` to create a custom network scenario that simulates a connection with frequent player [disconnects](#disconnects). See [`DisconnectScenarioWithMonoBehaviour.cs`](https://github.com/Unity-Technologies/com.unity.multiplayer.tools/blob/develop/Samples~/NetworkSimulator/DisconnectScenarioWithMonoBehaviour.cs).

### Unstable connection scenario

The following code snippet shows using `NetworkScenarioTask` to create a custom network scenario that simulates an [unstable connection](#instability). See [`UnstableConnection.cs`](https://github.com/Unity-Technologies/com.unity.multiplayer.tools/blob/develop/Samples~/NetworkSimulator/UnstableConnection.cs).

### Affect connection parameters using Animation Curves scenario

The following code snippet uses `NetworkScenarioBehaviour` to create a custom network scenario that simulates multiple connection problems. It dynamically changes multiple connection parameters using Animation Curves. See [`ConnectionParametersWithCurves.cs`](https://github.com/Unity-Technologies/com.unity.multiplayer.tools/blob/develop/Samples~/NetworkSimulator/ConnectionParametersWithCurves.cs).

The sample scenario showcases a dynamic scenario using an animation curve loop with variable [packet delays](#latency), [packet jittering](#jitter), and [packet loss](#packet-loss).

This is part one of the Porting from client-hosted to dedicated server-hosted series.

See the other pages in this series:

:::

You might have started developing your game with client-hosted in mind but then realized it wasn’t giving you the performance, reliability, or security you wanted. There are multiple reasons for choosing both a dedicated game server (DGS) solution and a client-hosted solution. This document provides guidance around switching from a client-hosted game to a dedicated-server game in Unity using [Netcode for GameObjects (NGO)](../about).

There are two distinct meanings of the word “host” that you must take caren't to confuse: the NGO host and the hardware host.

- The **NGO host** is where both a client and a server run simultaneously. The hosting provider (the hardware host) runs your Unity server build.
- The **hardware host** (virtual or bare-metal) runs your Unity server build in a data center or hosting provider.

In this article, host refers to the NGO host.

id: profiler
title: Network Profiler
sidebar_label: Network Profiler
---
:::caution
This guide uses Unity 2021.3 LTS.

On 2021.1 and below, the profiler outputs only simple statistics.
:::

Profiling is the process of measuring the performance of your game while it's running. It allows you to check your optimization points and control that your enhancements make a real difference.

In multiplayer game programming, you have three primary resources you need to keep under control:
- Bandwidth consumption
- CPU
- Latency

These three resources are the three vertices of a triangle with a constant area. For example, reducing your bandwidth consumption will probably increase your CPU cost and latency by using compression algorithms or heavier serialization strategies.

For this article, we will only focus on bandwidth profiling. You can find the official profiler documentation for CPU [here](https://docs.unity3d.com/Manual/ProfilerCPU.html).

Regarding latency, it's a whole topic in itself, but remember that we are talking about the time taken for sending a packet here, not the network latency. Thus, a simple StopWatch on your serialization and compression algorithms should be sufficient to measure the CPU latency you are introducing here.

## Prerequisites

Starting from Unity 2021.1, the Unity Profiler can be extended with features to support profiling the network traffic of multiplayer games built using Netcode for Game Objects (Netcode). These features are available as part of the Network Profiler included in the Multiplayer Tools package. The Network Profiler enables you to profile the networking activity of your game in the same profiler that you use to profile CPU, GPU, and memory.

To enable profiling support for Netcode, [install the Multiplayer Tools package](install-tools.md).

You should now see two additional modules in your profiler (**Window** > **Analysis** > **Profiler**):
* Messages - Network messages sent to the transport
* Objects - Activity related to, and grouped by, network objects

:::note
If you have the profiler window open when you install the tools package in 2020.3 or 2021.1, you may need to close and reopen the profiler window for the modules to appear.

The network profiler samples its data by frame rate. Therefore, you may find the graphs a little spiky.
:::

:::caution
Netcode for GameObjects does not update the legacy profiler modules **Network Messages** and **Network Operations**.
:::

## Messages Module

The following table includes the Messages the Netcode Profiler counts:

| Message | Description |
| -- | -- |
| Total Bytes Sent | Total number of bytes sent during this frame |
| Total Bytes Received | Total number of bytes received during this frame |
| Named Message Bytes Sent | Total number of named message bytes sent to any connection in this frame |
| Named Message Bytes Received | Total number of named message bytes received in this frame |
| Unnamed Message Bytes Sent | Total number of unnamed message bytes sent to any connection in this frame |
| Unnamed Message Bytes Received | Total number of unnamed message bytes received in this frame |
| Scene Event Bytes Sent | Total number of scene event bytes sent during this frame |
| Scene Event Bytes Received | Total number of scene event bytes received during this frame |

:::note
Messages sent to the local client (for example, a server in host mode sending RPCs to itself) appears greyed-out in the profiler to indicate that they may not actually be sent over the network.
:::

## Objects Module

The following table includes the Objects the Netcode Profiler counts:

| Object | Description |
| -- | -- |
| Rpc Bytes Sent | Total number of remote procedure calls (RPCs) sent in this frame |
| Rpc Bytes Received | Total number of remote procedure calls (RPCs) received in this frame |
| Network Variable Delta Sent | Total number of network variables sent as a first-time update for an object |
| Network Variable Delta Received | Total number of network variables sent as a delta |
| Object Spawned Sent | Total number of spawned objects sent in this frame |
| Object Spawned Received | Total number of spawned objects received in this frame |
| Object Destroyed Sent | Total number of destroyed objects sent in this frame |
| Object Destroyed Received | Total number of destroyed objects received in this frame |
| Ownership Change Sent | Total number of ownership changes sent |
| Ownership Change Received | Total number of ownership changes received |

## Known Issues for Versions Below 2021.2

* The profiler modules can be removed from the profiler by either using the **Restore Defaults** functionality or manually removing them. You can re-add them by re-opening the editor or recompiling a script.

* If you remove the tools package, the profiler modules remain in the profiler but aren't functional. You can remove them by using the **Restore Defaults** functionality or manually removing them.

## Best Practices

The profiler tool is capable of providing a lot of information and can be intimidating to determine the best strategy for optimization. Use the following best practices to make your optimization process easier.

### Module elements and filtering results

You can use the following filter rules to narrow your search results:

| Rule | Description |
| -- | -- |
| t: | Filters by type |
| dir:in | Filters anything with bytes received |
| dir:out | Filters anything with bytes sent |
| b>N | Filters all events with bytes greater than N (N being an integer) |
| b<N | Filters all events with bytes less than N (N being an integer) |

You can combine these rules to continue narrowing your results.

Double-clicking on an element shows it in the Unity hierarchy tab.

### Hide unnecessary content

You can hide profiler data to focus only on information you are interested in.

1. In the Profiler window, select the dropdown arrow for **Profiler Modules** and check only the modules you would like to focus on. For example, the **Messages** and **Objects** modules.

### Profiling a development build of your game

For the most accurate results, you want to profile your game as a development build on the target hardware whenever possible. To profile a development build of your game on Windows, OS X, Linux, or WebGL, see [Profile your application on a target platform](https://docs.unity3d.com/Manual/profiler-profiling-applications.html) for more information.

For iOS and Android, see [Profiling on mobile devices](https://docs.unity3d.com/Manual/profiler-profiling-applications.html).

### Profiling inside the Unity editor

When it's more useful to have a broader sense of performance quickly than high accuracy, you want to profile inside the Unity editor. For example, you may try enabling and disabling multiple GameObjects at runtime to determine the culprit for a performance problem.

To profile inside the Unity editor, see [Profiling in the Unity Editor](https://docs.unity3d.com/Manual/profiler-profiling-applications.html) for more information.

### Iterate your optimization

Every time you make  new feature or refactor an old one, profile your game. This allows you to compare each change with your performance to adjust for peak efficiency.

There are no definite rules with performance optimization. Profile your game regularly, investigate the nature of your optimization problems, experiment with different solutions, and measure the results of your changes.

The **Runtime Network Stats Monitor (RNSM)** is a configurable component to display various network stats in an on-screen display at runtime, including stats from the Netcode for GameObjects (Netcode) package and custom, user-defined stats.

# Prerequisites

You must use Unity Editor version 2021.2 or later.

To enable the Runtime Network Stats Monitor, [install the Multiplayer Tools package](install-tools.md).

You should now see the Runtime Network Stats Monitor from the **Unity Editor** top menu bar under **Component** > **Netcode**, or when searching for it by name after pressing **Component** > **Add..**.

:::note

You must have an object selected for these options to be available.

:::

# Adding the Runtime Network Stats Monitor to a Scene

To add the RNSM to your scene, you must add it as a component to an object:

1. Select an object in your scene.
2. Add the RNSM component by either:
   1. Selecting **Add Component** in the **Inspector** tab, you can start typing `RuntimeNetStatsMonitor` in the search field to select the **RuntimeNetStatsMonitor** component.

   OR

   2. Selecting **Add Component** in the **Inspector** tab, navigate to **Netcode** and select **RuntimeNetStatsMonitor**.

   OR

   3. From the top menu bar, go to **Component** > **Netcode** > **RuntimeNetStatsMonitor**.

:::bestpractice Best Practice

You can add the Runtime Network Stats Monitor component to any object in your scene and will work. However, you may want to consider creating an empty object specifically for the RNSM.

:::

# Configuring

You can configure the RNSM to your liking with its [Display Elements](#display-elements), [Panel Settings](#panel-settings), and [Styling](#styling-the-runtime-network-stats-monitor). You can find each of these settings from the **Inspector** tab of the RNSM component. The RNSM package comes with default settings for each option that you can use "as is" or as guidance for creating your own.

:::note

The default setting for the Display Elements, Panel Settings, and Styling are disabled and not adjustable by default. To make modifications or build your own, you need to create your own configuration presets. Instructions for each customization are below.

:::

## Display Elements

Each Display Element displays one or more stats that you can add, remove, or modify under the element's **Stats** field.

### To use the default Display Elements

1. It may already be the default in the **Configuration** field of the **Inspector** tab of the RNSM component.

OR

1. Open the RNSM component in the **Inspector** tab.
2. Click the circle to the right of the **Configuration** field.
3. Click the eye icon in the dialog menu.
4. Search for `default` and select the **DefaultNetStatsMonitorConfiguration**.

OR

1. From the **Project** tab, go to **Packages** > **Multiplayer Tools** > **NetStatsMonitor** > **Assets** > **Configurations**. The default configuration for the RNSM is in this folder.
2. Select the `GameObject` with the RNSM component so that it appears in the **Inspector** tab.
3. Drag the default configuration asset from the **Project** tab to the **Configuration** field under the **RuntimeNetStatsMonitor** component of your `GameObject`.

### To configure your own Display Elements presets

1. Select the **Assets** folder under the **Project** tab.
2. Right-click in the **Assets** folder, then navigate to **Create** > **Multiplayer** and click on **NetStatsMonitorConfiguration**.
3. The configuration script appears under the **Assets** folder and also opens in the **Inspector** tab.
4. From the **Inspector** tab, you can use the + or - symbols to add each Display Element you want to include in this preset. Each field is configurable from here.
5. Once configured, you can add your Display Elements configuration preset to your RNSM `GameObject` by selecting the RNSM `GameObject` to appear in the **Inspector** tab.
6. Your **Assets** folder should still be visible in the **Project** tab, so select your newly created configuration preset to drag over the **Configuration** field under the **RuntimeNetStatsMonitor** component in the **Inspector** tab.
7. **Save** your scene.

:::tip

It's recommended to use the default configuration as a guide to create your own for the RNSM. You can find it from the **Project** tab, go to **Packages** > **Multiplayer Tools** > **NetStatsMonitor** > **Assets** > **Configurations**.

:::

### Panel Settings

While working in the Unity Editor with the Runtime Network Stats Monitor, you may find your screen real estate to be difficult to work with. To help remedy these situations, you can use the default panel settings or create your own to set up your workspace exactly as you want it.

#### To use the default Panel Settings

1. From the **Project** tab, go to **Packages** > **Multiplayer Tools** > **NetStatsMonitor** > **Implementation** > **UI** > **Resources**. The default panel settings configuration for the RNSM is in this folder: `UnityMpToolsRnsmDefaultPanelSettings.asset`.
2. Select the `GameObject` with the RNSM component so that it appears in the **Inspector** tab.
3. Drag the default panel setting asset from the **Project** tab to the **Panel Settings Override** field under the **RuntimeNetStatsMonitor** component of your `GameObject`.

:::note

You can use the default Panel Settings for your RNSM or use it as a starting point for custom settings. Leaving the **Panel Settings Override** field blank enables the default settings.

:::

#### To configure your own Panel Settings presets

1. Select the **Assets** folder under the **Project** tab.
2. Right-click in the **Assets** folder, then navigate to **Create** > **UI Toolkit** and click on **Panel Settings Asset**.
3. The configuration script appears under the **Assets** folder and also opens in the **Inspector** tab.
4. From the **Inspector** tab, you can adjust each of the fields to fit your screen needs.
5. Once configured, you can add your Panel Settings preset to your RNSM `GameObject` by selecting the RNSM `GameObject` to appear in the **Inspector** tab.
6. Your **Assets** folder should still be visible in the **Project** tab, so select your newly created Panel Settings to drag over the **Panel Settings Override** field under the **RuntimeNetStatsMonitor** component in the **Inspector** tab.
7. **Save** your scene.

### Styling the Runtime Network Stats Monitor

You can customize the styling of the RNSM by dragging and dropping a Unity Style Sheet (USS) onto the **Custom Style Sheet** field of the RNSM component from the **Inspector** tab.

For more information about Unity Style Sheets (USS), see the Unity Documentation on [Styling the UI with USS](https://docs.unity3d.com/2021.2/Documentation/Manual/UIE-USS.html).

:::note

You can use the default USS file for the RNSM to style your RNSM or use it as a starting point for custom styling. Leaving the **Custom Style Sheet** field blank enables the default style sheet.

:::

#### To create a new style sheet for the RNSM

1. Select the **Assets** folder under the **Project** tab.
2. Right-click in the **Assets** folder, then navigate to **Create** > **UI Toolkit** and click on **Style Sheet**.
3. The new USS file appears under the **Assets** folder and also opens in the **Inspector** tab.
4. From the **Inspector** tab, you can use the + or - symbols to adjust each style element you want to include in this preset. Each field is configurable from here. You may find it easier to create or modify this file as a text file rather than with the **Inspector** ([Unity Style Sheets](https://docs.unity3d.com/2021.2/Documentation/Manual/UIE-USS.html) function similarly to Cascading Style Sheets).
5. Once configured, you can add your USS configuration preset to your RNSM `GameObject` by selecting the RNSM `GameObject` to appear in the **Inspector** tab.
6. Your **Assets** folder should still be visible in the **Project** tab, so select your newly created style sheet to drag over the **Custom Style Sheet** field under the **RuntimeNetStatsMonitor** component in the **Inspector** tab.
7. **Save** your scene.

:::tip

It's recommended to use the default style sheet as a guide to create your own style sheet for the RNSM. You can find it from the **Project** tab under **Packages** > **Multiplayer Tools** > **NetStatsMonitor** > **Implementation** > **UI** > **Resources** > **UnityMpToolsRnsmDefaultStyleSheet.uss**.

:::

#### USS Classes

A full list of USS class names that you can use to style the RNSM from the **Project** tab under **Packages** > **Multiplayer Tools** > **NetStatsMonitor** > **Configuration** > **UssClassNames.cs**.

## Using Custom Data in the Runtime Network Stats Monitor

To add custom data to the RNSM:

1. Create your custom data as a `.cs` file (see example below) either in an editor of your choice to import into the **Assets** folder of the **Projects** tab. Or right-click in your **Assets** folder of the **Projects** tab, select **Create** > **C# Script**. The new `.cs` file opens in the **Inspector** tab that you can use the **Open** button to edit and save.
2. Once your custom data `.cs` file is ready, you can drag the file from your **Assets** folder to an object in your scene as a new component.

:::best practice

Be sure your file name and class name match for your `.cs` file or it won't work.

:::

Below is an example of custom data you can use with the RNSM. You can use this example as a guide to create your own custom data to explore with RNSM. Be sure to name this file as `CustomStats` to match the class name.

```csharp
using Unity.Multiplayer.Tools.NetStats;
using Unity.Multiplayer.Tools.NetStatsMonitor;
using UnityEngine;

// User-defined metrics can be defined using the MetricTypeEnum attribute
[MetricTypeEnum(DisplayName = "CustomMetric")]
enum CustomMetric
{
    // Metadata for each user-defined metric can be defined using the MetricMetadata Attribute

    [MetricMetadata(Units = Units.Hertz, MetricKind = MetricKind.Gauge)]
    Framerate,

    [MetricMetadata(Units = Units.None, MetricKind = MetricKind.Gauge)]
    TriangleCount,

    [MetricMetadata(Units = Units.None, MetricKind = MetricKind.Gauge, DisplayAsPercentage = true)]
    CpuUsage,
}

public class CustomStats : MonoBehaviour
{
    RuntimeNetStatsMonitor m_NetStatsMonitor;

    void Start()
    {
        m_NetStatsMonitor = FindObjectOfType<RuntimeNetStatsMonitor>();
    }

    void Update()
    {
        // Once you have access to an instance of the RuntimeNetStatsMonitor
        // you can provide custom data to it using AddCustomValue,
        // using an enum with the MetricTypeEnum attribute.

        m_NetStatsMonitor.AddCustomValue(
            MetricId.Create(CustomMetric.Framerate),
            Random.Range(40, 60f));

        m_NetStatsMonitor.AddCustomValue(
            MetricId.Create(CustomMetric.TriangleCount),
            Random.Range(10000, 100000));

        m_NetStatsMonitor.AddCustomValue(
            MetricId.Create(CustomMetric.CpuUsage),
            Random.Range(0.05f, 0.4f));
    }
}
```

## Including/Excluding The Runtime Network Stats Monitor in Builds

To allow you to save space and other resources from builds, such as on mobile, the RNSM implementation can be included/excluded from a build independently from its interface (the RNSM component).

:::note

By default, after adding the **Multiplayer Tools** package, the Runtime Network Stats Monitor is included in the editor, included in development builds, and isn't included in release builds.

:::

### Excluding the RNSM from Development Builds

:::

Choosing between a client-hosted and a dedicated server game isn’t as straightforward as it might initially seem. There are multiple pros and cons to each solution, and the scales can easily tip one way or another depending on a multitude of factors, such as the game type, the latency tolerance, the game integrity (how easily players can cheat), and the expectations of your players. Sometimes, it might even make sense to have multiple hosting options. This section covers some pros and cons of each solution.

## Client-hosted games

A client-hosted game is a game that doesn’t rely on a dedicated server (or a server-specific build) to host game servers. Instead, the same executable has the code to run as a client or as a host. Players can run the client build locally as a host and allow other players to join through peer-to-peer connections or a peer-to-peer mimicking solution like [Relay](https://docs.unity.com/relay/).

:::note
NGO has three start options: [`StartClient`](../../api/Unity.Netcode.NetworkTransport#startclient), [`StartHost`](../../api/Unity.Netcode.NetworkManager#starthost) and [`StartServer`](../../api/Unity.Netcode.NetworkManager#startserver), and [`StartServer`](../../api/Unity.Netcode.NetworkTransport#startserver). A host acts as both a client and a server.
:::

Games that benefit most from a client-hosted hosting approach include games that:

- Don’t need to scale to large numbers of players
- Aren’t sensitive to lag or latency
- Aren’t sensitive to cheating

The following table lists some pros and cons of using a client-hosted hosting approach to host your multiplayer game.

| PROS | CONS |
|---|---|
| There are fewer costs associated with a client-hosted game because you don’t need to worry about paying for a hosting provider. ✝ | You don’t have control over the quality of service (QoS) of connections because they depend on the host player’s network. |
| It's easier to manage builds in client-hosted games because you only need to release a single build for players. | Depending on the game type, players might become frustrated because it’s not fair that the host player has zero latency. |
| Client-hosted games are simpler to debug and profile compared to dedicated server-hosted games (your development PC can also run the host, a DGS might run on specialized hardware). | Players can more easily cheat because they have physical access to the server. |
| The above makes it great for LAN (local area network) parties. | Client-hosted games don’t scale well. Player hardware usually isn’t capable of hosting game sessions with hundreds of connections. |

✝ However, some games might generate more traffic (compared to compute resources), which might make a client-hosted game more expensive than using a service like Unity Multiplay Hosting if relying too much on Relay.

## Dedicated server-hosted games

A dedicated server-hosted game is a game that runs server builds on hardware that’s dedicated to hosting the game. The dedicated server might be in an [on-premise data center](./hosting-considerations.md#developer-hosted-cloud), in the [cloud](./hosting-considerations#developer-hosted-cloud), or made available through a [managed service provider](#managed-service-provider), such as Unity’s [Multiplay Hosting](https://docs.unity.com/game-server-hosting). In any case, players don’t usually have access to the server build.

Games that benefit most from a dedicated server-hosted hosting approach include those that:

- Are sensitive to latency and lag
- Are competitive and sensitive to cheating
- Need to scale to large numbers of players

The following table lists some pros and cons of using a dedicated server hosting approach to host your multiplayer game.

| PROS | CONS |
|---|---|
| Players don’t have access to your server build, which makes it easier to keep game authority and security. | You have to worry about uptime, quality of service, latency, and geographic availability. |
| There’s no extra lag due to relay based connections. | You must consider scalability because the number of players connected to your server fleet can change drastically in a short time. |
| You have more control over performance and quality of service since you as a developer control the hardware the server runs on. | It can quickly get expensive, depending on how you host the server build. |
| It’s easier to think about the server part of your code and the client part of your code when there’s no overlap like a client-hosted game. | It’s more complicated to debug because you usually need to run the production build in a virtual machine for testing. |
| Clients don’t require as much performance because they aren't responsible for the processing and bandwidth overhead involved with hosting. | You have to keep a server build and a client build. |
| You don’t have to worry about host migrations or what to do when the host player disconnects. ✝ |  |
| You don’t have to worry about the unfairness of the host having zero latency or lag. |  |
| You have the option of using a managed service provider like Unity Multiplay Hosting, which allows you to focus on other aspects of your game. |  |

✝ However, you still need to accommodate for unexpected server failures. These failures are less likely to happen, but you still need to handle them with appropriate error messaging.

title: About Unity Transport
---

The Unity Transport package (`com.unity.transport`) is a low-level networking library for multiplayer game development.

It’s the underlying protocol of both [Netcode for GameObjects](../docs/about.md) and [Netcode for Entities](https://docs.unity3d.com/Packages/com.unity.netcode@latest), but you can also use it with a custom solution.

Unity Transport seamlessly supports all platforms the Unity Engine supports thanks to a connection-based abstraction layer (built-in network driver) provided over UDP and WebSockets.

You can set up both UDP and WebSockets with or without encryption. The following illustration shows encrypted connections with a closed padlock and unencrypted connections with an open padlock.

![Block diagram](/img/transport/layercake-2.png)

You can also use [pipelines](pipelines-usage.md) to leverage additional functionality, such as reliability, packet ordering, and packet fragmentation.

## Get started with Unity Transport

See the [Installation](install.md) guide if you’re new to Unity Transport. If you’re upgrading from a earlier version of Unity Transport, see [Migrating from 1.X](migration.md). Check the [Compatibility with Unity Editor versions](#compatibility-with-unity-editor-versions) table to ensure your Editor version is compatible with Transport 2.X or 1.X.

## Main Features of Transport 2.0

* Addition of WebGL: Transport package can now be used for all Unity Engine supported platforms.
* Transport users now have access to our Websocket transport implementation, with or without TLS. It is supported on every platform as Client or Server and for WebGL as Client only.
* Players on the go can now benefit from a transparent network migration, typically across cell towers. The feature is currently limited to client side and for UDP transport.
* The integration with Relay more is straightforward thanks to a new set of API that are now abstracting some boiler plate code.
* Added support for com.unity.logging package. If the package is installed, logs will go through its default logger instead of the classic UnityEngine.Debug mechanism.

### Compatibility with Unity Editor versions

Based on your Unity Editor Version

| Unity Editor Version | Transport 1.X | Transport 2.X |
|---|---|---|
| 2020 LTS | Yes | No |
| 2021 LTS | Yes | No |
| 2022.2 and LTS | Yes | Yes |
| Next | No | Yes |

Based on your Netcode Solution working with Transport

| Unity Editor Version | Netcode for GameObjects 1.2.0 + | Netcode for Entities 1.0.0 + | Custom Solutions |
|---|---|---|---|

--- transport/cross-play.md ---

id: cross-play
title: Cross-Play support
---

Cross-play is the ability of players on different platforms to play together in the same game session. This is normally not an issue when all players use the same connection type, but it can be when different players must use different means of connecting to a server. For example, players on desktop platforms might use a UDP-based connection, whereas players on WebGL would use WebSockets.

## Cross-play with Unity Relay

When using [Unity Relay](https://docs.unity.com/relay/en/manual/introduction), then cross-play support comes for free, without you having to do anything to enable it. You could have a host connecting to the Relay server with DTLS, a client connecting with WebSocket, and another connecting with UDP, and both clients will be able to communicate with the host without any issue.

Refer to the [Unity Relay documentation](https://docs.unity.com/relay/en/manual/relay-and-utp) for details on how to select a connection type for your host and client connections.

## Cross-play with direct connections
When connecting `NetworkDriver` instances directly to each other without using Unity Relay as the intermediary, the situation is more complicated. `NetworkDriver` can only accept connections on a single connection type. For example, a driver that is using the `WebSocketNetworkInterface` and is bound to an IPv4 endpoint will only be able to accept connections made from WebSocket clients with IPv4 addresses.

A solution to this problem is simply to use multiple `NetworkDriver` instances. For example, one driver for accepting UDP connections, and another to accept WebSocket connections. But that can be bothersome to work with. To simplify this workflow, Unity Transport provides a handy `MultiNetworkDriver` component.

### Overview of MultiNetworkDriver

A `MultiNetworkDriver` is a container for multiple `NetworkDriver` instances. Its API is mostly the same as `NetworkDriver`, so pretty much everywhere you would use `NetworkDriver`, you can use `MultiNetworkDriver` instead.

On creation, a `MultiNetworkDriver` is empty. You can add `NetworkDriver` instances to it with the `AddDriver` method. There are a few limitations to what drivers can be added:

1. The added driver must already be in the `Listening` state. That is, one must already have called `Listen` on the `NetworkDriver` instance before adding it.
2. No connections must have been already made to the added driver.
3. The added driver must have the same number of [pipelines](pipelines-usage.md) configured as previously-added drivers.

A `MultiNetworkDriver` can have a maximum of 4 `NetworkDriver` instances added to it. How these drivers are defined is up to you. They could use different network interfaces (e.g. UDP vs WebSocket), listen on different endpoints, use different configuration values, etc.

Below you'll find examples for two common cases: listening to both UDP and WebSocket connections, and listening on an IPv4 and an IPv6 endpoint. Note that for brevity's sake, error handling is omitted from these examples. In real production code you should check the values returned by `Bind` and `Listen`.

### Example: UDP and WebSockets

This example shows how to create a `MultiNetworkDriver` that will accept connections from both UDP and WebSocket clients. A full working version of that example (including client code) is provided with the Unity Transport package in the "CrossPlay" sample.

First, we need to create a `NetworkDriver` that will accept the UDP connections:

```c sharp
var udpDriver = NetworkDriver.Create(new UDPNetworkInterface());
udpDriver.Bind(NetworkEndpoint.AnyIpv4.WithPort(7777));
udpDriver.Listen();
```

Next, we create a `NetworkDriver` that will accept the WebSocket connections:

```c sharp
var wsDriver = NetworkDriver.Create(new WebSocketNetworkInterface());
wsDriver.Bind(NetworkEndpoint.AnyIpv4.WithPort(7778));
wsDriver.Listen();
```

Finally, we can create the `MultiNetworkDriver` and add both of our drivers to it:

```c sharp
var multiDriver = MultiNetworkDriver.Create();
multiDriver.AddDriver(udpDriver);
multiDriver.AddDriver(wsDriver);
```

At this point, `multiDriver` can be used as you would a normal `NetworkDriver`. You can `Accept` new connections, pop events with `PopEvent` or `PopEventForConnection`, send messages with `BeginSend` and `EndSend`, schedule updates with `ScheduleUpdate`, etc. Clients will be able to reach the server on UDP port 7777 (for UDP connections) and TCP port 7778 (for WebSocket connections).

:::note
While it is possible to keep references to udpDriver and wsDriver around and operate on them individually, it is not recommended to do so. Once a driver is added to a MultiNetworkDriver, only that MultiNetworkDriver should be used to operate on the NetworkDriver. For example, do not call ScheduleUpdate on udpDriver or wsDriver. Instead, call the ScheduleUpdate method of multiDriver.
:::

### Example: IPv4 and IPv6

This example shows how to create a `MultiNetworkDriver` that will accept connections from both IPv4 and IPv6 addresses (using the default UDP-based protocol). This can be very useful for servers for mobile games as cellular networks are increasingly IPv6-based.

First, we create the `NetworkDriver` that will listen to IPv4 addresses:

```c sharp
var ipv4Driver = NetworkDriver.Create();
ipv4Driver.Bind(NetworkEndpoint.AnyIpv4.WithPort(7777));
ipv4Driver.Listen();
```

Next, we create the `NetworkDriver` that will listen to IPv6 addresses:

```c sharp
var ipv6Driver = NetworkDriver.Create();
ipv6Driver.Bind(NetworkEndpoint.AnyIpv6.WithPort(7777));
ipv6Driver.Listen();
```

Finally, we add both drivers to a `MultiNetworkDriver`:

```c sharp
var multiDriver = MultiNetworkDriver.Create();
multiDriver.AddDriver(ipv4Driver);
multiDriver.AddDriver(ipv6Driver);
```

With this setup, calling `multiDriver.Accept` can now return connections made by IPv4 and IPv6 clients in a transparent manner. If you wish to know if any given connection was made from an IPv4 or IPv6 client, you can use `GetRemoteEndpoint` to get the address of a client.

### Advanced usage: per-driver pipeline definitions

All the drivers in a `MultiNetworkDriver` are normally expected to have matching pipelines. If all your drivers are expected to have the same pipeline configurations, then you can simply add the pipelines directly with the `CreatePipeline` method of `MultiNetworkDriver`. For example:

```c sharp
// Add a simulator pipeline to all drivers in multiDriver.
multiDriver.CreatePipeline(typeof(SimulatorPipelineStage));
```

But there might be occasions where you might not want all pipelines to be configured the same way. For example, if you have a driver configured for WebSocket connections, there is no need to ever use `ReliableSequencedPipelineStage` since WebSocket is built on top of TCP which already provides all the guarantees of the reliable pipeline stage.

In such situations, we can create the pipelines before adding the drivers to the `MultiNetworkDriver`. Here's an example:

```c sharp
// Create a UDP driver with a reliable pipeline.
var udpDriver = NetworkDriver.Create(new UDPNetworkInterface());
var reliablePipeline = udpDriver.CreatePipeline(typeof(ReliableSequencedPipelineStage));
udpDriver.Bind(NetworkEndpoint.AnyIpv4.WithPort(7777));
udpDriver.Listen();

// Create a WebSocket driver with a "dummy" reliable pipeline.
var wsDriver = NetworkDriver.Create(new WebSocketNetworkInterface());
var dummyPipeline = wsDriver.CreatePipeline(typeof(NullPipelineStage));
wsDriver.Bind(NetworkEndpoint.AnyIpv4.WithPort(7778));
wsDriver.Listen();

// Add both drivers to a new MultiNetworkDriver.
var multiDriver = MultiNetworkDriver.Create();
multiDriver.AddDriver(udpDriver);
multiDriver.AddDriver(wsDriver);
```

In the above example, `reliablePipeline` and `dummyPipeline` are actually equal. Either one could be used with our `MultiNetworkDriver` to send traffic reliably:

```c sharp
// Will send the value 42 reliably. If connection is UDP-based, then this will send
// the packet through the ReliableSequencedPipelineStage. If it is WebSocket-based,
// then this will send the packet through the NullPipelineStage, which does nothing.
multiDriver.BeginSend(reliablePipeline, connection, out var writer);
writer.WriteInt(42);
multiDriver.EndSend(writer);
```

:::note
Pipelines in all drivers added to a MultiNetworkDriver are expected to have symmetric functions. That is, if the first pipeline is a reliable one, then it must be so for all drivers in the MultiNetworkDriver. This is why we create a "dummy" pipeline for the WebSocket driver in the example above. We still need some pipeline to act as the reliable one, even if this pipeline does nothing.
:::

### Sharing code between server and client

You may have noticed that all examples above use `MultiNetworkDriver` in a server role. While this is indeed its main intended usage, using it only as a server can be problematic if you have code shared between your server and client builds. For example, if you had common networking code that used `NetworkDriver`, porting it to `MultiNetworkDriver` could be difficult since that code would then need to use a `MultiNetworkDriver` on the server, and a `NetworkDriver` on clients.

To address this problem, `MultiNetworkDriver` can also act as a container for client drivers. A non-listening driver can be added to a `MultiNetworkDriver` and connected to a server in the manner below:

```c sharp
var clientDriver = NetworkDriver.Create();
var multiDriver = MultiNetworkDriver.Create();

var driverId = multiDriver.AddDriver(clientDriver);
var connection = multiDriver.Connect(driverId, serverEndpoint);
```

There is no real performance penalty from using a `MultiNetworkDriver` that contains a single `NetworkDriver`. So having both server and client builds rely on `MultiNetworkDriver` is a good way of writing code that can be shared between them. In a way, `MultiNetworkDriver` then serves the purpose of an hypothetical `INetworkDriver` interface for the functionality common between NetworkDriver and `MultiNetworkDriver` (the transport package does not actually provide such an interface because it would be impractical to use in Burst-compiled code).

Unity Transport integrates well with the Unity Logging package (`com.unity.logging`), an efficient alternative to the standard Unity logger. Normally, log messages go through `UnityEngine.Debug.Log`. However, if you include both packages in a project, Unity Transport automatically uses `Unity.Logging` with the default logger settings.

id: migration
title: Migrate from 1.X
description: How to deal with breaking changes introduced in version 2.0 of Unity Transport.
---

This section describes the breaking changes introduced in version 2.0 of the Unity Transport Package (UTP). It also explains how to update projects written for version 1.X.

:::note
In most use cases, there’s no need to perform any additional steps to migrate from 1.X to 2.0. The core APIs (like `NetworkDriver`) remain the same, and the most significant changes are limited to specialized scenarios, such as [custom network interfaces](#custom-network-interfaces).
:::

## Collections-related errors following upgrade

It is possible that upgrading a project from version 1.X to 2.0 will result in errors like the following appearing in the console:

```
Unity.Collections/NativeParallelHashSetExtensions.gen.cs(17,51): error CS0246: The type or namespace name 'NativeHashSet<>' could not be found (are you missing a using directive or an assembly reference?)

Unity.Collections/UnsafeParallelHashSetExtensions.gen.cs(1084,78): error CS0246: The type or namespace name 'UnsafeHashSet<>' could not be found (are you missing a using directive or an assembly reference?)
```

There errors can occur when upgrading the Collections package from version 1.2 to 2.X. Closing and restarting the editor is usually enough to get rid of the errors.



## Editor version support

UTP 1.X supports Unity Editor 2020.3 and up, but 2.0 only supports 2022.2 and up to keep the Collections package dependency up to date. Unity Editor 2022.2 brings changes to the core Unity Engine runtime, allowing more code to be Burst-compiled. UTP benefits from this through increased performance.

:::note
UTP 1.X remains fully supported on LTS versions 2020.3 and 2021.3, and Unity will continue to release bug fixes and improvements. However, some features (like [WebSocket](workflow-client-server-ws.md) support) will only be available in UTP 2.0 and up.
:::

## DataStreamReader/DataStreamWriter moved to Collections

UTP 2.0 moves the `DataStreamReader` and `DataStreamWriter` APIs to the Collections package to make them more widely available outside UTP. As a result, updating to UTP 2.0 might require you to add a using `Unity.Collections` directive at the top of files using the `DataStreamReader` and `DataStreamWriter` APIs.

The APIs are mostly unchanged, except for raw pointers. `Unity.Collections.LowLevel.Unsafe` namespace now provides the raw pointer methods with Unsafe appended to their names. For example, the method `WriteBytes(byte*, int)` is now `WriteBytesUnsafe(byte*, int)`.

## Protocol incompatibility

The custom communication protocol UTP uses to implement connections over UDP has changed in a backward-incompatible manner, which means clients running UTP 2.0 or later can't connect to servers running 1.X, and vice versa. If you try to establish a connection between UTP 2.0 and UTP 1.X, UTP returns a connection failure after the usual timeout.

Due to the incompatibility between UTP 2.0 and UTP 1.X, you must either ensure that you update clients and servers simultaneously or disallow older clients from connecting to updated servers. Alternatively, you can create different endpoints for UTP 1.X and 2.0 servers to smooth the transition while you update older clients.

These breaking changes improve bandwidth efficiency, simplify the protocol, and lay the foundations for better forward compatibility.

## Custom network interfaces

The updates in UTP 2.0 heavily modify the `INetworkInterface` API used to implement custom network interfaces (the low-level layer to send and receive packets) to simplify it.

UTP 2.0 introduces the following breaking changes to custom network interfaces:

- UTP 2.0 no longer has the idea of `NetworkInterfaceEndPoint`; the more general `NetworkEndpoint` replaces `NetworkInterfaceEndPoint`. As a result, you don't need to implement conversion logic between `NetworkEndpoint` and `NetworkInterfaceEndPoint` anymore, so INetworkInterface omits `CreateInterfaceEndPoint` and `GetGenericEndPoint`.
- You no longer need to create a `NetworkSendInterface` through `CreateSendInterface`. `ScheduleSend` handles send operations, which get passed a `PacketsQueue` containing the packets to send.
- The `ScheduleReceive` method doesn't use the (now obsolete) `NetworkPacketReceiver` to propagate received packets to the rest of UTP. Instead, implementations of `ScheduleReceive` should fill the `PacketsQueue` passed in with the received packets.
- Implementations of `INetworkInterface` must now be fully compatible with Burst. If an implementation is incompatible with Burst, you can wrap it into a compatible implementation with the new `WrapToUnmanaged` extension method.
- You must now create NetworkDrivers using a custom network interface using the static `NetworkDriver.Create` method. For example, `NetworkDriver.Create(new MyCustomInterface())` creates a `NetworkDrivernamed MyCustomInterface()`. Directly constructing a NetworkDriver with new is deprecated.
- `INetworkInterface.Initialize` now takes another parameter: a reference to the packet padding, and you can increase this value to reserve space for headers.

These breaking changes simplify and increase the flexibility of the interface, making it easier to create custom network interfaces.

## Pipeline stages

UTP 2.0 don't introduce changes to how you write custom pipeline stages. However, the mechanisms you should use to register and get the identifier of a pipeline stage have changed:

- Instead of registering a custom pipeline stage with `NetworkPipelineStageCollection.RegisterPipelineStage`, use `NetworkDriver.RegisterPipelineStage`. You must do this on every instance of `NetworkDriver` that uses the custom pipeline stage.
- Instead of retrieving the ID of a pipeline stage with `NetworkPipelineStageCollection.GetStageId`, use the static `NetworkPipelineStageId.Get` method.

These breaking changes remove Burst-incompatible APIs, allowing you to use more of UTP with Burst-compiled code.

For more information, see the [section on using pipelines](https://docs.unity3d.com/Packages/com.unity.transport@2.2/manual/pipelines-usage.html).

## Other breaking changes

UTP 2.0 also introduces the following breaking changes:

* You must now complete a `NetworkDriver.ScheduleUpdate` job when notifying the remote peer of a disconnection after calling `NetworkDriver.Disconnect`. In 1.X, `NetworkDriver.ScheduleFlushSend` was enough to tell a remote peer of a disconnection, but this isn't the case with UTP 2.0. This change supports new protocols, such as WebSockets, where disconnecting might involve more work than simply sending a message.
* Using `SimulatorPipelineStageInSend` is now deprecated. Instead, use SimulatorPipelineStage and configure the new `ApplyMode` parameter to the direction desired (send, receive, or both).
* `NetworkSettings.WithBaselibNetworkInterfaceParameters` is now deprecated. You can no longer configure the maximum payload size; UTP handles the payload size automatically. However, you can configure the receive and send queue sizes with `NetworkSettings.WithNetworkConfigParameters`.
* UTP 2.0 removes `NetworkSettings.WithDataStreamParameters` and `NetworkSettings.WithPipelineParameters`. You no longer need to manually configure either of these parameters, so the methods are unnecessary. You can safely delete calls to these methods.
* You no longer need to configure read and handshake timeouts through `NetworkSettings.WithSecureClientParameters` and `NetworkSettings.WithSecureServerParameters`. Instead, UTP derives the values automatically from other configuration parameters. You can safely remove these settings from these calls.

The following are essential, high-level terms used in multiplayer networking and Netcode for GameObjects:

import MTTterms from '/static/shared/_terminology.md';

<MTTterms/>

--- transport/network-settings.md ---

id: network-settings
title: Network settings
---

The configuration of the `NetworkDriver` is defined using the `NetworkSettings` API. It might be required to change some of the default values of the parameters, that can be done as in the following example.

```csharp title="NetworkSettings example"
var settings = new NetworkSettings();
settings.WithNetworkConfigParameters(disconnectTimeoutMS: 1000);
var driver = NetworkDriver.Create(settings);
```

## Extending the NetworkSettings

When extending Unity Transport it's often useful to add custom parameters or settings that users can set to define the configuration of the `NetworkDriver`.
S
That can be done by extending the `NetworkSettings` API so the custom Network Interfaces or Pipelines can capture the parameter values inside the `Initialization` method as detailed in the following sections.

### INetworkParameter

By implementing the `INetworkParameter` interface, any unmanaged struct can be identified as a network parameter that can be assigned to the `NetworkDriver` settings.

The `NetworkSettings` will automatically call the `Validate()` method and will throw an exception if `false` is returned.

```csharp title="INetworkParameter example"
public struct MyCustomParameter : INetworkParameter
{
    public int MyCustomInt;
    public float MyCustomFloat;

    public bool Validate()
    {
        if (MyCustomInt <= 0)
        {
            UnityEngine.Debug.LogError($"{nameof(MyCustomInt)} value ({MyCustomInt}) must be greater than 0");
            return false;
        }

        return true;
    }
}
```

### `NetworkSettings` extension methods

Every new custom `INetworkParameter` requires of at least one extension method to the `NetworkSettings` API. These extension methods must receive and return a `ref NetworkSettings` to ensure the proper functioning of the fluent interface.

Those constraints are checked by the Roslyn Analyzers provided in the Unity Transport package.

```csharp title="NetworkSettings extension methods example"
public static class MyCustomParameterExtensions
{
    private const int k_MyCustomIntDefault = 1024;
    private const float k_MyCustomFloatDefault = 1.0f;

    public static ref NetworkSettings WithMyCustomParameters(
        ref this NetworkSettings settings,
        int myCustomInt = k_MyCustomIntDefault,
        float myCustomFloat = k_MyCustomFloatDefault
    )
    {
        var parameter = new MyCustomParameter
        {
            MyCustomInt = myCustomInt,
            myCustomFloat = myCustomFloat,
        };

        settings.AddRawParameterStruct(ref parameter);

        return ref settings;
    }

    public static MyCustomParameter GetMyCustomParameters(ref this NetworkSettings settings)
    {
        if (!settings.TryGet<MyCustomParameter>(out var parameter))
        {
            parameter.MyCustomInt = k_MyCustomIntDefault;
            parameter.MyCustomFloat = k_MyCustomFloatDefault;
        }

        return parameter;
    }
}
```

id: pipelines
title: Pipeline use
---

Pipelines are a core functionality of Unity Transport that allows selectively adding layers of functionality on top of the standard unreliable datagrams that UTP provides by default.

You can use pipelines to add sequencing, reliability, and fragmentation features.

Pipelines are a sequence of one or more stages. When you **send** a message through a pipeline, Unity Transport runs through the stages in order, piping the output of the first stage into the second stage. As a result, if the first stage adds a header to the packet, the second stage processes the entire packet, including the header added by the first stage. When you **receive** a message, it goes through the same chain of stages in reverse order.

![Pipeline stages](/img/transport/pipeline-stages-2.png)

`FragmentationPipelineStage` allows breaking large messages into smaller pieces, and `ReliableSequencedPipelineStage` allows sending messages with guaranteed order and delivery. The following example shows how to create a pipeline with both functionalities:

```csharp
// In initialization code, before any connections are made.
var myPipeline = driver.CreatePipeline(
    typeof(FragmentationPipelineStage), typeof(ReliableSequencedPipelineStage));
```

This creates a pipeline where Unity Transport first fragments messages into smaller pieces (that each fit in a packet), then delivers the individual packets reliably and in the correct order.

![Block diagram](/img/transport/fragmentation-2.png)

This illustration shows the process of fragmentation and delivering packets in order. The small orange pieces on the fragments represent sequence numbers and other information added by the reliable stage.

:::note
The order of the stages in a pipeline is important. If you reverse the order, UTP only adds the reliability information to the larger unfragmented message. Doing so is less bandwidth-efficient because losing any single fragment would result in needing to resend the entire unfragmented message. By ordering the reliable stage after fragmentation, you only need to resend a single fragment if you lose a fragment.
:::

You can pass the pipeline to `BeginSend` to send a message on this new pipeline:

```csharp
driver.BeginSend(myPipeline, connection, out var writer);
```

You can use the last argument of `PopEvent`/`PopEventForConnection` to know which pipeline you received a message on:

```csharp
var eventType = driver.PopEvent(out _, out _, out var receivePipeline);
if (eventType == NetworkEvent.Type.Data)
{
    // Data message was received on the receivePipeline pipeline.
}
```

:::note
You should always configure pipelines the same way on the server and client. The CreatePipeline calls (and their order) must match on both ends of a connection. Unity Transport doesn't protect you against mismatched pipelines between servers and clients.
:::

## The fragmentation pipeline stage

By default, Unity Transport can only send messages that fit into the [MTU](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maximum_transmission_unit) (roughly 1400 bytes). You must split larger messages into smaller pieces. This process is called message fragmentation.

Pipelines configured with a `FragmentationPipelineStage` automatically fragment messages for you. You can configure the maximum pre-fragmentation payload size when creating a `NetworkDriver`:

```csharp
var settings = new NetworkSettings();
settings.WithFragmentationStageParameters(payloadCapacity: 10000);

var driver = NetworkDriver.Create(settings);
var fragmentedPipeline = driver.CreatePipeline(typeof(FragmentationPipelineStage));
```

The maximum value is about ~20 megabytes. However, the fragmentation pipeline stage is only optimized for payloads of a few kilobytes (the default value is 4096 bytes). We don't recommend sending messages much larger than a few kilobytes unless it’s a one-time transmission at initialization.

Furthermore, if you use this pipeline stage with the `ReliableSequencedPipelineStage`, the maximum value is even lower at around 88 kilobytes.

:::note
Most pipeline stages don't support packets larger than the MTU (maximum transmission unit). As a result, in most cases, you should use `FragmentationPipelineStage` as the first stage in pipelines with multiple stages.
:::

## The reliable pipeline stage

Pipelines configured with a `ReliableSequencedPipelineStage` guarantee the delivery and order of their packets, similar to how a [TCP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transmission_Control_Protocol) connection would. The `ReliableSequencedPipelineStage` tags packets with a sequence number and peers acknowledge the reception of these numbers. If a peer doesn't acknowledge a packet, UTP resends it until it’s acknowledged. If a packet arrives out of order, UTP buffers it until it receives all earlier packets.

While reliability is useful, you should use it sparingly in a multiplayer game context. Reliable data streams can suffer from [head-of-line blocking](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Head-of-line_blocking), which can cause increased latency and delay packet processing. We recommend using the `ReliableSequencedPipelineStage` pipeline stage only for important traffic you can't afford to lose (like RPCs and character actions).

### Maximum in-flight packets

The reliable stage limits the number of packets in-flight at any given time. The default limit is 32, but you can increase the limit up to 64. The in-flight packet limit is per connection and per pipeline; it's not shared across connections.

Due to the in-flight package limitation, we recommend batching reliable messages together as much as possible. For example, instead of sending two reliable messages of 20 bytes each, concatenate them and send a single message of 40 bytes.

If you try to send a new reliable message while the maximum number of packets is already in-flight, `EndSend` returns the error code `NetworkSendQueueFull` (value `-5`). If you encounter this situation, we recommend storing the message in a queue until it's possible to send it again:

```csharp
driver.BeginSend(myReliablePipeline, connection, out var writer);
// Write your message to the writer.
if (driver.EndSend(writer) == (int)Error.StatusCode.NetworkSendQueueFull))
{
    // Copy your message to a queue, and try resending later.
}
```

### Increasing the limit

You can change the in-flight package limit when creating a `NetworkDriver`:

```csharp
var settings = new NetworkSettings();
settings.WithReliableStageParameters(windowSize: 64);

var driver = NetworkDriver.Create(settings);
var reliablePipeline = driver.CreatePipeline(typeof(ReliableSequencedPipelineStage));
```

The default limit is 32, and the maximum is 64. Any value higher than 32 results in slightly large (4 bytes) headers, leaving much less space for actual data in the packets.

## The simulator pipeline stage

The `SimulatorPipelineStage` is meant to be used when testing your application. It allows you to simulate network conditions like packet loss, delay, and jitter. You can use this stage to know how a game might behave in a real-world environment.

You can configure the network conditions when creating a `NetworkDriver`:

```csharp
var settings = new NetworkSettings();
settings.WithSimulatorStageParameters(
    maxPacketCount: 100,
    mode: ApplyMode.AllPackets,
    packetDelayMs: 50);

var driver = NetworkDriver.Create(settings);
var simulatorPipeline = driver.CreatePipeline(typeof(SimulatorPipelineStage));
```

The following list has some important parameters of the `SimulatorPipelineStage`.

* `maxPacketCount` is the maximum number of simultaneously delayed packets. Past that, packets go through without any added delay.
* mode In which direction the simulator should apply the network conditions (send, receive, or both).
* `packetDelayMs` is the delay in milliseconds to apply to packets. Good values range between `20` (for a good broadband connection) and `200` (for a bad mobile connection).
* `packetJitterMs` is the deviation around the packet delay in milliseconds. This value is typically half the packet delay or slightly less.
* `packetDropPercentage` is the percentage of packets to drop. You should use values above `3`, even for bad mobile connections.

:::note
SimulatorPipelineStage should normally be the last in the chain when creating a pipeline with multiple stages. Otherwise, packets might drop before other stages can process them (which isn't useful for a reliable pipeline, for example).

id: using-sample
title: Sample projects
---

The Unity Transport package comes with a `Samples` folder containing simple assembly definitions and associated scenes that illustrate the basic functionality of the Unity Transport package library. These sample projects include:

## SimpleClientServer

The [SimpleClientServer](workflow-client-server-udp.md) sample covers all aspects of the Unity Transport package and helps you create a sample project that highlights how to use the API to:

- Configure the transport
- Establish a connection
- Send data
- Receive data
- Close a connection

The goal is to make a remote "add" function. The flow will be: a client connects to the server, and sends a number. This number is then received by the server that adds another number to it and sends it back to the client. The client, upon receiving the number, closes the connection.

## JobifiedClientServer

Continuing from the the [SimpleClientServer](#simpleclientserver) sample, the [JobifiedClientServer](workflow-client-server-jobs.md) sample walks you through creating a client and server that use jobs. Using jobs allows you to take advantage of parallel code execution.

## Ping

The Ping sample project implements a simple ping-pong service and supplies client and server behaviors for two scenarios.

- The first scenario uses `PingMainThreadServerBehaviour` and `PingMainThreadClientBehaviour` to implement peers to process messages only in the main thread.
- The second scenario shows how to use the Burst compiler and the job system with `PingServerBehaviour` and `PingClientBehaviour`.

## Pipeline

The Pipeline sample shows how to define [pipeline](pipelines-usage.md) stages as described in [Pipelines](pipelines-usage.md). The code shows a pipeline definition for unreliable sequenced delivery based on a default `UDPNetworkInterface`.

:::note
Consider using pipeline stages carefully. Some pipeline configurations can't add value to the quality of service and might be harmful, depending on the underlying `NetworkInterface` you use. For example, it makes sense to have a pipeline stage for unreliable sequenced delivery over a `UDPNetworkInterface`. The same [pipeline](pipelines-usage.md) stage over a `WebSocketNetworkInterface` incurs unnecessary overhead because the underlying network interface already provides unreliable sequenced delivery.
:::

## RelayPing

The RelayPing sample project extends the [Ping](#ping) sample project to use the [Unity Relay Service](https://unity.com/products/relay) to connect players. It shows how to manipulate and pass custom [Network Settings](network-settings.md) to a `NetworkDriver`.

id: jobs
title: Efficient client and server
---

This section guides you through creating a jobified client and server. It extends and modifies the [minimal client and server example](workflow-client-server-udp.md) to use jobs to leverage parallel code execution.

:::warning
Before reading this tutorial, you should understand how the [C# Job System](https://docs.unity3d.com/Manual/JobSystem.html) works.
:::

## Create a jobified client

This section shows how to create a jobified client to handle inputs from the network. Because you only handle one client at a time, use [`IJob`](https://docs.unity3d.com/ScriptReference/Unity.Jobs.IJob.html) as your job type. You need to pass the driver and the connection to the job to handle updates within the job’s Execute method.

```csharp
struct ClientUpdateJob: IJob
{
    public NetworkDriver driver;
    public NativeArray<NetworkConnection> connection;
    public NativeArray<byte> done;

    public void Execute() { ... }
}
```

:::note
The data inside the `ClientUpdateJob` is copied. If you want to use the data after completing the job, you must have your data in a shared container, such as a [`NativeContainer`](https://docs.unity3d.com/Manual/JobSystemNativeContainer.html).
:::

You should update the `NetworkConnection` and the done variables inside the job because you might receive a disconnect message. Verify you can share the data between the job and the caller. In this case, use a [`NativeArray`](https://docs.unity3d.com/ScriptReference/Unity.Collections.NativeArray_1.html).

:::note
You can only use [blittable types](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/framework/interop/blittable-and-non-blittable-types) in a NativeContainer. In this case, because `bool` isn't blittable, you must use a `byte` instead of `bool`.
:::

Move the code from the Update method (from [`ClientBehaviour.cs`](samples/clientbehaviour.cs.md)) to the Execute method.

You need to change any call to `m_Connection` to `connection[0]` to refer to the first element inside the `NativeArray`. The same goes for your done variable; you must call `done[0]` when you refer to the done variable. See the following code snippet:

```csharp
public void Execute()
{
    if (!connection[0].IsCreated)
    {
        // Remember that its not a bool anymore.
        if (done[0] != 1)
            Debug.Log("Something went wrong during connect");
        return;
    }
    DataStreamReader stream;
    NetworkEvent.Type cmd;

    while ((cmd = connection[0].PopEvent(driver, out stream)) != NetworkEvent.Type.Empty)
    {
        if (cmd == NetworkEvent.Type.Connect)
        {
            Debug.Log("We are now connected to the server");

            var value = 1;
            driver.BeginSend(connection[0], out var writer);
            writer.WriteUInt(value);
            driver.EndSend(writer);
        }
        else if (cmd == NetworkEvent.Type.Data)
        {
            uint value = stream.ReadUInt();
            Debug.Log("Got the value = " + value + " back from the server");
            // And finally change the `done[0]` to `1`
            done[0] = 1;
            connection[0].Disconnect(driver);
            connection[0] = default(NetworkConnection);
        }
        else if (cmd == NetworkEvent.Type.Disconnect)
        {
            Debug.Log("Client got disconnected from server");
            connection[0] = default(NetworkConnection);
        }
    }
}
```

### Update the client MonoBehaviour

When you have a job, you must verify that you can execute the job. The following code sample shows the changes to `ClientBehaviour`:

* Change `m_Done` and `m_Connection` to type `NativeArray`.
* Add a [JobHandle](https://docs.unity3d.com/Manual/JobSystemJobDependencies.html) to track ongoing jobs.

```csharp
public class JobifiedClientBehaviour : MonoBehaviour
{
    public NetworkDriver m_Driver;
    public NativeArray<NetworkConnection> m_Connection;
    public NativeArray<byte> m_Done;
    public JobHandle ClientJobHandle;

    public void OnDestroy() { ... }
    public void Start() { ... }
    public void Update() { ... }
}
```

#### Start method

The Start method looks similar to the one in the simple client example; the most significant update is that the jobified version verifies that you create a `NativeArray`.

```csharp
void Start () {
    m_Driver = NetworkDriver.Create();
    m_Connection = new NativeArray<NetworkConnection>(1, Allocator.Persistent);
    m_Done = new NativeArray<byte>(1, Allocator.Persistent);

    var endpoint = NetworkEndPoint.LoopbackIpv4;
    endpoint.Port = 9000;

    m_Connection[0] = m_Driver.Connect(endpoint);
}
```

#### `OnDestroy` method

In the `OnDestroy` method, dispose of all `NativeArray` objects. Then add a `ClientJobHandle.Complete()` call to ensure the jobs complete before you clean up and destroy the data they might be using.

```csharp
public void OnDestroy()
{
    ClientJobHandle.Complete();

    m_Connection.Dispose();
    m_Driver.Dispose();
    m_Done.Dispose();
}
```

#### Client `Update` loop

Update the core game loop. Ensure the last frame completes before running the new frame. Instead of calling `m_Driver.ScheduleUpdate().Complete()`, use the `JobHandle`, then call `ClientJobHandle.Complete()`.

```csharp
void Update()
{
    ClientJobHandle.Complete();
    ...
}
```

Next, create a job struct to chain the job:

```csharp
var job = new ClientUpdateJob
{
    driver = m_Driver,
    connection = m_Connection,
    done = m_Done
};
```

To schedule the job, pass the `JobHandle` dependency returned from the `m_Driver.ScheduleUpdate` call in the Schedule function of your `IJob`. Start by invoking the `m_Driver.ScheduleUpdate` without a call to `Complete`, and pass the returning `JobHandle` to the saved `ClientJobHandle`.

Pass the returned `ClientJobHandle` to the job you created, returning a newly updated `ClientJobHandle`.

```csharp
ClientJobHandle = m_Driver.ScheduleUpdate();
ClientJobHandle = job.Schedule(ClientJobHandle);
```

You now have a `JobifiedClientBehaviour` that looks like [this](samples/jobifiedclientbehaviour.cs.md).

## Create a jobified server

The jobified server is similar to the simple server in the earlier example. The only necessary modification is to create the jobs you need, then update the usage code.

The `NetworkDriver` has a `ScheduleUpdate` method that returns a `JobHandle` that populates the internal buffers of the `NetworkDriver` and provides the `PopEvent`/`PopEventForConnection` method. You can use the [`IJobParallelFor`](https://docs.unity3d.com/Manual/JobSystemParallelForJobs.html) job type to create a job to run the processing code for all connected clients in parallel.

:::note
There’s another `IJobPrarallelFor` job type you can use: `IJobParallelForDefer`. This job type suits the jobified server because you don’t know the exact number of requests the server might receive or the number of connections the server might need to process.
:::

```csharp
struct ServerUpdateJob : IJobParallelForDefer
{
    public void Execute(int index)
    {
        throw new System.NotImplementedException();
    }
}
```

However, you can only run some of your code in parallel.

The jobified client begins by cleaning up closed connections and accepting new ones, which you can't do in parallel. Instead, you must create a connection job.

Create a `ServerUpdateConnectionJob` job, then pass both the driver and connections to the connection job. This job should clean up connections and accept new connections:

```csharp
struct ServerUpdateConnectionsJob : IJob
{
    public NetworkDriver driver;
    public NativeList<NetworkConnection> connections;

    public void Execute()
    {
        // Clean up connections
        for (int i = 0; i < connections.Length; i++)
        {
            if (!connections[i].IsCreated)
            {
                connections.RemoveAtSwapBack(i);
                --i;
            }
        }
        // Accept new connections
        NetworkConnection c;
        while ((c = driver.Accept()) != default(NetworkConnection))
        {
            connections.Add(c);
            Debug.Log("Accepted a connection");
        }
    }
}
```

The code above is nearly the same as the non-jobified server code from the simple server example.

With the `ServerUpdateConnectionsJob` done, implement the `ServerUpdateJob` using `IJobParallelFor`:

```csharp
struct ServerUpdateJob : IJobParallelForDefer
{
    public NetworkDriver.Concurrent driver;
    public NativeArray<NetworkConnection> connections;

    public void Execute(int index)
    {
        ...
    }
}
```

The `ServerUpdateJob` has two significant differences compared with the `ServerUpdateConnectionJob` job:

* The `ServerUpdateJob` uses the `NetworkDriver.Concurrent` type, which allows you to call the `NetworkDriver` from multiple threads. This is precisely what you need for the `IParallelForJobDefer`.
* The `ServerUpdateJob` passes a `NativeArray` of type `NetworkConnection` instead of a `NativeList`. The `IParallelForJobDefer` doesn't accept any other `Unity.Collections` type than a `NativeArray`.

### Execute method

The only difference in the Execute method between the simple server code and the jobified server code is that you remove the top-level for loop in the jobified server:

```csharp
for (int i = 0; i < m_Connections.Length; i++)
```

The jobified server doesn’t need this top-level for loop because it calls the Execute function for each connection, and passes in the index to that available connection.

```csharp
public void Execute(int index)
{
    DataStreamReader stream;
    Assert.IsTrue(connections[index].IsCreated);

    NetworkEvent.Type cmd;
    while ((cmd = driver.PopEventForConnection(connections[index], out stream)) !=
    NetworkEvent.Type.Empty)
    {
        if (cmd == NetworkEvent.Type.Data)
        {
            uint number = stream.ReadUInt();

            Debug.Log("Got " + number + " from the Client adding + 2 to it.");
            number +=2;

            driver.BeginSend(connections[index], out var writer);
            writer.WriteUInt(number);
            driver.EndSend(writer);
        }
        else if (cmd == NetworkEvent.Type.Disconnect)
        {
            Debug.Log("Client disconnected from server");
            connections[index] = default(NetworkConnection);
        }
    }
}
```

The top-level `while` loop uses the index of the available connection:

```csharp
while ((cmd = driver.PopEventForConnection(connections[index], out stream)) != NetworkEvent.Type.Empty`
```

:::note
Use the index of the connection (passed into the `Execute` method) to iterate over all the connections.
:::

You now have two jobs:

* The first job, `ServerUpdateConnectionJob`, updates the connection status by adding new connections and removing old connections.
* The second job, `ServerUpdateJob`, parses the `NetworkEvent` for each connected client.

### Update the server `MonoBehaviour`

Next, access the jobified server [`MonoBehaviour`](https://docs.unity3d.com/ScriptReference/MonoBehaviour.html) and start updating the server.

```csharp
public class JobifiedServerBehaviour : MonoBehaviour
{
    public NetworkDriver m_Driver;
    public NativeList<NetworkConnection> m_Connections;
    private JobHandle ServerJobHandle;

    void Start () { ... }

    public void OnDestroy() { ... }

    void Update () { ... }
}
```

The only change between the simple server and the jobified server variable declaration is that the jobified server adds a JobHandle to keep track of ongoing jobs.

#### Server `Start` method

You don’t need to change the `Start` method from the simple server example:

```csharp
void Start ()
{
    m_Connections = new NativeList<NetworkConnection>(16, Allocator.Persistent);
    m_Driver = new NetworkDriver.Create();

    var endpoint = NetworkEndPoint.AnyIpv4;
    endpoint.Port = 9000;
    if (m_Driver.Bind(endpoint) != 0)
        Debug.Log("Failed to bind to port 9000");
    else
        m_Driver.Listen();
}
```

#### Server `OnDestroy` method

Remember to call `ServerJobHandle.Complete` in the `OnDestroy` method to clean up the code:

```csharp
public void OnDestroy()
{
    // Make sure we run our jobs to completion before exiting.
    if (m_Driver.IsCreated)
    {
        ServerJobHandle.Complete();
        m_Connections.Dispose();
        m_Driver.Dispose();
    }
}
```

#### Server `Update` loop

Call `Complete` on the `JobHandle` in the Update method to force the jobs to complete before you start a new frame:

```csharp
void Update ()
{
    ServerJobHandle.Complete();

    var connectionJob = new ServerUpdateConnectionsJob
    {
        driver = m_Driver,
        connections = m_Connections
    };

    var serverUpdateJob = new ServerUpdateJob
    {
        driver = m_Driver.ToConcurrent(),
        connections = m_Connections.ToDeferredJobArray()
    };

    ServerJobHandle = m_Driver.ScheduleUpdate();
    ServerJobHandle = connectionJob.Schedule(ServerJobHandle);
    ServerJobHandle = serverUpdateJob.Schedule(m_Connections, 1, ServerJobHandle);
}
```

Use the following process to chain the jobs:

1. `NetworkDriver.Update`
2. `ServerUpdateConnectionsJob`
3. `ServerUpdateJob`

Start by populating the `ServerUpdateConnectionsJob` with the `NetworkDriver` and the connections:

```csharp
var connectionJob = new ServerUpdateConnectionsJob
{
    driver = m_Driver,
    connections = m_Connections
};
```

Next, create the `ServerUpdateJob`. Remember to call `ToConcurrent` on the `NetworkDriver` to ensure you’re using a concurrent driver for the `IParallelForJobDefer`:

```csharp
var serverUpdateJob = new ServerUpdateJob
{
    driver = m_Driver.ToConcurrent(),
    connections = m_Connections.ToDeferredJobArray()
};
```

Verify the `NativeArray` is populated with the correct size. You can verify the `NativeArray` size using a `DeferredJobArray`. `DeferredJobArray` verifies that the connections array is populated with the same number of items in the connections list.

:::note
The size of the connections list might change when you first run `ServerUpdateConnectionsJob`.
:::

Create the job chain and call `Scheduele` as follows:

```csharp
ServerJobHandle = m_Driver.ScheduleUpdate();
ServerJobHandle = connectionJob.Schedule(ServerJobHandle);
ServerJobHandle = serverUpdateJob.Schedule(m_Connections, 1, ServerJobHandle);
```

In the code above, you:

* Scheduled the `NetworkDriver` job.
* `JobHandle` is returned as a dependency on the `ServerUpdateConnectionJob`.
* The final link in the chain is the `ServerUpdateJob`. It must run after `ServerUpdateConnectionsJob` to invoke the `IJobParallelForDeferExtensions`. `m_Connections` `NativeList` passed to the `Schedule` method, which updates the connections count before starting the job. It fans out and runs all `ServerUpdateConnectionJobs` in parallel.

You now have a fully functional [jobified server](https://docs.unity3d.com/Packages/com.unity.transport@2.2/manual/samples/jobifiedserverbehaviour.cs.html).

## Use Burst for extra performance

All the jobs in the example code adhere to [the subset of C# supported by Burst](https://docs.unity3d.com/Packages/com.unity.burst@1.7/manual/docs/CSharpLanguageSupport_Types.html). Burst is a compiler that pre-compiles Unity jobs into highly-performant native code. Unity Transport takes advantage of Burst and uses mostly Burst-friendly data structures (like `NetworkDriver`).

You can make a job Burst-compiled by adding the [`BurstCompile`] attribute to its definition. For example:

```csharp
[BurstCompile]
struct ClientUpdateJob : IJob
{
    ...
}
```

Refer to the [Burst documentation](https://docs.unity3d.com/Packages/com.unity.burst@latest) for more details on how to use it.

id: secure-connection
title: Create a secure client and server
---
<!-- Called "Encrypted communications" in UTP package docs -->

You can configure the Unity Transport package to encrypt the connection between the server and clients while ensuring the authenticity of both.

:::note
Secure connections are available in Unity Editor versions 2020.3 (starting at 2020.3.34), 2021.3, and 2022.1 and above.
:::

## Server authentication

This section shows using encrypted communications with Unity Transport.

:::warning
This example uses hardcoded certificates to make understanding the process easier. In a real deployment, you should keep the server certificates separate from client builds. You can separate server and client certificates by using separate assemblies or loading them from a file on the server.
:::

### High-level authentication process

In this configuration, the server provides a certificate to the client (certificate) to prove its identity. The client compares the server’s certificate against its own root certificate (`caCertificate`) to validate the server’s identity.

:::note
Root certificates are also sometimes referred to as CA certificates.
:::

After the client confirms the server's identity, the server uses the private key (`privateKey`) to establish a secure communication channel.

### Requirements

To use the secure communication workflow, you need the following:

- A valid certificate
- The root certificate used to sign the certificate
- The private key used to create the certificate

If you don't have these, you can use OpenSSL to generate them. The following section explains how to use OpenSSL to generate certificates.

### Generate keys and certificates

This section explains how to use OpenSSL to generate a valid certificate (a requirement for using encrypted connections). Before continuing, ensure you have [OpenSSL](https://www.openssl.org/) installed on your machine.

#### Generate the root certificate

Generate a root private key. You need the root private key to generate the root certificate.

```csharp
openssl genrsa -out clientPrivateKeyForRootCA.pem 2048
```

Use the root private key to generate the root certificate.

```csharp
openssl req -x509 -new -nodes -key clientPrivateKeyForRootCA.pem -sha256 -days 1095 -out myGameClientCA.pem
```

OpenSSL will prompt you to answer several questions. Most of the answers aren't that important within the present context. It's useful to use a common name that makes sense for you to identify this certificate, amongst others. Ideally, you want to use a domain name you own (if you have one).

#### Generate the root-signed certificate to use with the server

Create a private key for the server.

```csharp
openssl genrsa -out myGameServerPrivateKey.pem 2048
```

Use the private key to generate a certificate signing request.

```csharp
openssl req -new -key myGameServerPrivateKey.pem -out myGameServerCertificateSigningRequest.pem
```

OpenSSL will prompt you with the same questions you answered when you generated the root certificate. The answers are no more important. However, we recommend you use the server's hostname.

Using the different files generated, create the certificate file the server will use to authenticate itself:

```csharp
openssl.exe x509 -req -in myGameServerCertificateSigningRequest.pem -CA myGameClientCA.pem -CAkey clientPrivateKeyForRootCA.pem -CAcreateserial -out myGameServerCertificate.pem -days 365 -sha256
```

You should now have five generated files. Out of these, you only need the following three:

- `myGameClientCA.pem` - You need the content of the client CA to use client-side as the `caCertificate` parameter.
- `myGameServerCertificate.pem` - You need the server certificate to use server-side for the certificate parameter.
- `myGameServerPrivateKey.pem` - You need the server private key to use server-side for the `privateKey` parameter.

### Boilerplate file holding the secure parameters

When you have all the requirements, create a `SecureParameters.cs` script file to hold your certificates and the private key. Place it in the same folder as the minimal server and minimal client scripts. Then declare the `SecureParameters` static class and the boilerplate code to hold the secure information:

```csharp
public static class SecureParameters
{
    // Use the common name you used to create the server certificate.
    public static readonly string ServerCommonName = "localserver";

    public static readonly string MyGameClientCA =
@"-----BEGIN CERTIFICATE-----
*** Contents of myGameClientCA.pem ***
-----END CERTIFICATE-----";

    public static readonly string MyGameServerCertificate =
@"-----BEGIN CERTIFICATE-----
*** Contents of myGameServerCertificate.pem ***
-----END CERTIFICATE-----";

    public static readonly string MyGameServerPrivateKey =
@"-----BEGIN RSA PRIVATE KEY-----
*** Contents of myGameServerPrivateKey.pem ***
-----END RSA PRIVATE KEY-----";
}
```

### Create a secure server

This section shows creating a secure server. It uses the simple server code example as a starting point.

Start by creating a `NetworkSettings` object in the `Start` method and configure it as follows:

```csharp
void Start ()
{
    var settings = new NetworkSettings();
    settings.WithSecureServerParameters(
        certificate: SecureParameters.MyGameServerCertificate,     
        privateKey: SecureParameters.MyGameServerPrivateKey);

    // ...
}
```

When creating the `NetworkDriver`, pass in this `NetworkSettings` object:

```csharp
m_Driver = NetworkDriver.Create(settings);
```

That’s all you need to do to enable secure communication server-side.

### Create a secure client

This section shows creating a secure client. It uses the simple client code example as a starting point.

The secure client is similar to the secure server. The only difference is in how you configure the NetworkSettings object.

```csharp
void Start ()
{
    var settings = new NetworkSettings();
    settings.WithSecureClientParameters(
        serverName: SecureParameters.ServerCommonName,     
        caCertificate: SecureParameters.MyGameClientCA);
    m_Driver = NetworkDriver.Create(settings);

    // ...
}
```

You should now have a secure connection between the server and its clients!

:::warning
If you create clients for multiple platforms, all clients must use the same root certificate if they communicate with the same server.
