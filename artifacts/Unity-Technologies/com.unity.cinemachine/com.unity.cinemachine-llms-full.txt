# Cinemachine Impulse Sources

An Impulse Source is a component that emits a vibration signal from a point in Scene space. Game events can cause an Impulse Source to emit a signal from the place where the event occurs. The event _triggers_ impulses, and the source _generates_ impulses. CinemachineCameras with an Impulse Listener extension _react_ to impulses by shaking.

In the image below, the figure's feet are Impulse Sources. When they collide with the floor (A) they generate impulses. The camera is an Impulse Listener and reacts to the impulses by shaking (B), which shakes the resulting image in the game view (C).

![In this Scene, the figure's feet are Impulse Sources. When they collide with the floor (A) they generate impulses. The camera is an Impulse Listener and reacts to the impulses by shaking (B), which shakes the resulting image in the game view (C). ](images/ImpulseOverview.png)

Cinemachine ships with two types of Impulse Source components.

- **[Cinemachine Collision Impulse Source](CinemachineCollisionImpulseSource.md)** generates impulses in reaction to collisions and trigger zones.

- **[Cinemachine Impulse Source](CinemachineImpulseSource.md)** generates impulses in reaction to events other than collisions.

Your Scene can have as many Impulse Sources as you want. Here are a few examples of where you might use Impulse Source components in a Scene:

- On each of a giant’s feet, so that the ground shakes when the giant walks.

- On a projectile that explodes when it hits a target.

- On the surface of a gelatin planet that wobbles when something touches it.

By default, an Impulse Source affects every [Impulse Listener](CinemachineImpulseListener.md) in range, but you can apply [channel filtering](CinemachineImpulseFiltering.md#ChannelFiltering) to make Sources affect some Listeners and not others.

## Key Impulse Source properties

While the vibration signal defines the basic “shape” of the camera shake, the Impulse Source controls several other important properties that define the impulses it generates.

For descriptions of all Impulse Source properties, as well as instructions for adding Impulse Sources to your scene, see documentation on the [Impulse Source](CinemachineImpulseSource.md) and [Collision Impulse Source](CinemachineCollisionImpulseSource.md) components.

# Installation and upgrade

Cinemachine is a free package, available for any project.

To install this package, follow the instructions in the [Package Manager documentation](https://docs.unity3d.com/Manual/upm-ui.html).

> [!TIP]
> Once the installation is complete, a new **GameObject** > **Cinemachine** menu is available to add [pre-built Cinemachine Cameras](ui-ref-pre-built-cameras.md) according to your needs.

## Installation requirements

This version of Cinemachine is compatible with the following versions of the Unity Editor:

* 2022.3 LTS and later

Cinemachine has few external dependencies. Just install it and start using it. If you are also using the Post Processing via HDRP or URP volumes, then adapter modules are provided - protected by `ifdef` directives which auto-define if the presence of the dependencies is detected.  

There are similar `ifdef`-protected behaviours for other packages, such as Timeline and UGUI.

## Cinemachine project upgrade

If you have a project that uses an earlier version of Cinemachine and you need to update it to use the latest Cinemachine version, refer to the links in the table below.

> [!CAUTION]
> The Cinemachine 3.x architecture includes many breaking changes compared to Cinemachine 2.x and earlier versions. While it is possible to upgrade an existing project from Cinemachine 2.x to Cinemachine 3.x, you should think carefully about whether you are willing to put in the work.

| Section | Description |
| :--- | :--- |
| [Upgrade your project from Cinemachine 2.x](CinemachineUpgradeFrom2.md) | Instructions to follow if your project currently uses Cinemachine 2.x. |
| [Upgrade from the Asset Store version of Cinemachine](CinemachineUpgradeFromAssetStore.md) | Instructions to follow if your project currently uses a former version of Cinemachine from the Asset Store (prior to version 2.x). |

# Camera control and transitions

Learn about the conditions and mechanisms that make Cinemachine Cameras take turns controlling the Unity Camera and transition between each other by blend or cut.

## Cinemachine Camera states

At any time, each Cinemachine Camera may be in one of three different states, but only one is **Live** and controls the Unity Camera at a time, except when a blend occurs.

| State | Description |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Live** | The Cinemachine Camera actively controls a Unity Camera that has a Cinemachine Brain.<br />When a [blend](#blends) occurs from one Cinemachine Camera to the next, both Cinemachine Cameras are live. When the blend is complete, there is only one live Cinemachine Camera. |
| **Standby** | The Cinemachine Camera doesn’t control the Unity camera. However, it still follows and aims at its targets, and updates.<br />A Cinemachine Camera in this state has its GameObject activated and a priority that is the same as or lower than the live Cinemachine Camera. |
| **Disabled** | The Cinemachine Camera doesn’t control the Unity camera and doesn’t actively follow or aim at its targets.<br />A Cinemachine Camera in this state doesn’t consume processing power. To disable a Cinemachine Camera, deactivate its GameObject. The Cinemachine Camera is present but disabled in the Scene. However, even though the GameObject is deactivated, the Cinemachine Camera can still control the Unity camera if the Cinemachine Camera is participating in a blend, or if Timeline invokes it. |

## Live Cinemachine Camera selection

The conditions that make a Cinemachine Camera the live one depend on the context in which you're using Cinemachine.  By default, the Cinemachine Brain is responsible for handling the live Cinemachine Camera selection.

- The Brain chooses the active [Cinemachine Camera component](CinemachineCamera.md) with the highest Priority and makes it Live.
- If multiple active CinemchineCameras share the same highest priority, then the most recently [activated](https://docs.unity3d.com/Manual/DeactivatingGameObjects.html) of them will be chosen.
- Deactivated or lower-priority CinemachineCameras can be Live if they are part of a blend, until the blend is finished.
- If a Timeline is active with Cinemachine tracks, it overrides the Brain's priority system and drives the Live cameras and blends explicitly, regardless of their Priority and active state.

### Realtime dynamic events

You can respond to dynamic game events in real time by manipulating Cinemachine Camera priorities or by activating and deactivating their GameObjects. This is particularly useful for live gameplay, where action isn’t always predictable.

### Timeline

Use [Cinemachine with Timeline](concept-timeline.md) to choreograph Cinemachine Cameras and manage shots in predictable situations, like cutscenes.

When you use Timeline with Cinemachine Cameras, Timeline overrides the Cinemachine Brain priority system, meaning that the Priority and active state of the Cinemachine Cameras is ignored when a Cinemachine Camera Clip is active. The live Cinemachine Camera selection is based on the activation of specific Cinemachine Camera clips that give you precise, to-the-frame camera control.

## Cinemachine Camera transitions

You can manage transitions between Cinemachine Cameras each time a new one becomes live.

The ways to set up Cinemachine Camera transitions are different depending on the context you're using Cinemachine in:
* By default, you handle transition rules in the [Cinemachine Brain component](CinemachineBrain.md).
* When you're using Timeline for shot sequencing, you handle transitions directly in the Timeline Cinemachine track.

### Blends

Blends allow you to create sophisticated camera motion by combining relatively simple shots and blending between them in response to real-time game events or in a choreographed way via a timeline.

A Cinemachine blend is not a fade, wipe, or dissolve. Rather, Cinemachine performs a smooth animation of the position, rotation, and other settings of the Unity Camera from one Cinemachine Camera to the next, taking care to preserve the view of the target object, and to respect the Up direction.

![Diagram that shows the smooth transition of camera control between two Cinemachine Cameras during a blend.](images/concept-transition-blend.png)  
_**Blend:** The two Cinemachine Cameras simultaneously control the Unity Camera during the blend, smoothly exchanging full control over a predetermined time._

### Cuts

By definition, a cut is an abrupt transition from a shot to another. In Cinemachine, a cut between two Cinemachine Cameras corresponds to a blend that occurs instantly, without smooth transition between Cinemachine Camera properties.

![Diagram that shows the abrupt transition of camera control between two Cinemachine Cameras in two cuts.](images/concept-transition-cut.png)  
_**Cut example:** two Cinemachine Cameras taking turns controlling the Unity Camera instantly._

# Cinemachine essential elements

Learn about the essential elements that make a functional Cinemachine environment.

## Overview

A functional Cinemachine setup involves three main types of elements:

* A single [**Unity Camera**](#unity-camera) which captures the images across the Scene,
* A [**Cinemachine Brain**](#cinemachine-brain) which enables the Cinemachine functionality in the Unity Camera, and
* One or multiple [**Cinemachine Cameras**](#cinemachine-cameras) which take turns controlling the Unity Camera according to their status.

![Cinemachine setup example: the Unity Camera with its Cinemachine Brain component and three Cinemachine Cameras.](images/concept-base.png)

## Unity Camera

The Unity Camera is a GameObject that includes a [Camera](https://docs.unity3d.com/Manual/class-Camera.html) component, as opposed to Cinemachine Cameras, which includes other types of components to control the Unity Camera.

A Cinemachine setup must include **only one Unity Camera**, which is then the only GameObject that captures the images from your Scene while the Cinemachine Cameras control it.

## Cinemachine Brain

To work with Cinemachine, the Unity Camera GameObject must include a [**Cinemachine Brain component**](CinemachineBrain.md). This component is mainly responsible to:
* Monitor all active Cinemachine Cameras in the Scene.
* Determine which Cinemachine Camera controls the Unity Camera.
* Handle the transition when another Cinemachine Camera takes control of the Unity Camera.

> [!NOTE]
> When you use Timeline to get a choreographed sequence of Cinemachine Camera shots, Timeline overrides the Cinemachine Brain for Cinemachine Camera priority and transition management.

## Cinemachine Cameras

The Cinemachine Cameras (formerly named _Virtual Cameras_) are GameObjects that act as camera placeholders ready to [take control](concept-camera-control-transitions.md) of the Unity Camera according to their status.

When a Cinemachine Cameras takes control of the Unity Camera, it dynamically overrides its properties and behavior, which affects:
* Where the Unity Camera is positioned in the Scene.
* What the Unity Camera aims at.
* The Unity Camera's lens settings (field of view, clipping planes, etc).
* The Unity Camera's post-processing profiles (if used).
* How the Unity Camera behaves through time.

### Cinemachine Camera GameObjects

Cinemachine Camera GameObjects are separate from the Unity Camera GameObject.
* They behave independently, and must not be nested within each other.
* They don't include a Camera component, as opposed to the Unity Camera GameObject.
* They must include a [Cinemachine Camera component](CinemachineCamera.md).
* They can include additional Cinemachine components to manage [procedural motion](concept-procedural-motion.md) and add extended functionality.

![Hierarchy example: a Scene containing a Unity Camera with Cinemachine Brain and multiple Cinemachine Cameras.](images/CinemachineSceneHierarchy.png)

### Single or multiple Cinemachine Cameras

You can create as many Cinemachine Cameras as required for your project, but you can also get a fully functional setup with a single Cinemachine Camera, depending on your needs. For example:

* If you want the Unity Camera to follow a single character, you can use a single Cinemachine Camera and set it up with a follow behavior that corresponds to your needs. In the end, this Cinemachine Camera will be the only one to control the Unity Camera.

* If your project requires multiple shots over multiple places, you should create one Cinemachine Camera per shot, with or without specific procedural behavior. In that case, you have to understand how Unity handles Cinemachine Camera activations and transitions.

### Processing power consumption

Cinemachine encourages you to create many Cinemachine Cameras. The Cinemachine Camera is designed to consume little processing power. If your Scene is performance-sensitive, deactivate all but the essential Cinemachine Cameras at any given moment for best performance.

# Procedural Motion

On its own, a Cinemachine Camera is a **passive** GameObject that acts as a camera placeholder that you can, for example:
* Place in a fixed location with a static aim.
* Parent to another GameObject to make it move and rotate along with it.
* Manipulate via a custom script to move and rotate it and control its lens.

However, for more sophisticated results, you can add **procedural** behaviors and extensions to any Cinemachine Camera to make it dynamically move, shake, track targets, compose its own shots, respond to user inputs, move along a predefined path, react to external impulse signals, produce post-processing effects, and more.


## Procedural behaviors and extensions

The [Cinemachine Camera component](CinemachineCamera.md) allows you to select a variety of behaviors and extensions to drive the Cinemachine Camera's position, rotation, and lens.

### Position and Rotation Control

Select and configure **Position Control** and **Rotation Control** behaviors to make the Cinemachine Camera **move** and **aim** the Unity Camera according to some constraints or criteria.

Most of the available behaviors are designed to [track or look at a target GameObject](#target-gameobject-tracking).  Additionally, some behaviors support user input to orbit or rotate the camera.

With these behaviors, you can:
* Follow a target with a [fixed offset](CinemachineFollow.md), in [orbital configuration](CinemachineOrbitalFollow.md), or as a [third or first person](CinemachineThirdPersonFollow.md).

* Compose shots with adaptive camera [position](CinemachinePositionComposer.md) and [rotation](CinemachineRotationComposer.md), or centered [hard look](CinemachineHardLookAt.md), to keep the target in the camera frame.

* Apply the target's [position](CinemachineHardLockToTarget.md) and [rotation](CinemachineRotateWithFollowTarget.md) to the camera instead of having the target in the camera frame.

* Move the camera along a predefined Spline to simulate a [dolly camera path](CinemachineSplineDolly.md).

* Rotate the camera around configurable [pan and tilt](CinemachinePanTilt.md) axes.

### Noise

Select and configure a [**Noise** behavior](CinemachineBasicMultiChannelPerlin.md) to make the Cinemachine Camera **shake** and simulate real-world physical camera qualities for cinematic effect.

At each frame update, Cinemachine adds noise separately from the movement of the camera to follow a target. Noise does not influence the camera’s position in future frames. This separation ensures that properties like **damping** behave as expected.

### Extensions

Add an **Extension** to augment the behavior of a Cinemachine Camera for more specific or advanced needs.

For example, the [Deoccluder](CinemachineDeoccluder.md) extension moves a camera out of the way of GameObjects that obstruct the camera’s view of its target.

Here is the list of all available Cinemachine Camera Extensions:

  * [Cinemachine Auto Focus](CinemachineAutoFocus.md)
  * [Cinemachine Confiner 3D](CinemachineConfiner3D.md)
  * [Cinemachine Confiner 2D](CinemachineConfiner2D.md)
  * [Cinemachine Decollider](CinemachineDecollider.md)
  * [Cinemachine Deoccluder](CinemachineDeoccluder.md)
  * [Cinemachine Follow Zoom](CinemachineFollowZoom.md)
  * [Cinemachine FreeLook Modifier](CinemachineFreeLookModifier.md)
  * [Cinemachine Group Framing](CinemachineGroupFraming.md)
  * [Cinemachine Pixel Perfect](CinemachinePixelPerfect.md)
  * [Cinemachine Post Processing](CinemachinePostProcessing.md)
  * [Cinemachine Recomposer](CinemachineRecomposer.md)
  * [Cinemachine Shot Quality Evaluator](CinemachineShotQualityEvaluator.md)
  * [Cinemachine Storyboard](CinemachineStoryboard.md)
  * [Cinemachine Third Person Aim](CinemachineThirdPersonAim.md)
  * [Cinemachine Volume Settings](CinemachineVolumeSettings.md)
  <!---* Cinemachine Camera Offset (component/extension, missing in docs)--->


## Target GameObject tracking

Target GameObject tracking is a key element in defining procedural motion. Offsets and screen compositions are specified in relation to these targets, so as the targets move around in the world, the cameras adjust themselves to keep the shot.

### Tracking Target and Look At Target properties

By default, a Cinemachine Camera has a single **Tracking Target** property, which serves two purposes:

* It specifies a Transform for the Cinemachine Camera to move with when you define a position control behavior that requires it.
* It specifies the LookAt target, which is the Transform to aim at when you define a rotation control behavior that requires it.

> [!NOTE]
> If you need to use two different Transforms for these purposes, select **Use Separate LookAt Target** option via the button at the right of the **Tracking Target** field.

### Target tracking and blends

The target is also relevant when Cinemachine performs blends between shots. Cinemachine attempts to maintain the shot's desired screen position for the target, and if the target changes between shots, Cinemachine performs an interpolation between the targets' positions.

If no target is specified for a camera blend, then Cinemachine can only interpolate the position and rotation independently, which often results in the object of interest moving around on the screen in undesirable ways. If Cinemachine knows what is the object of interest, it can correct that problem.


## Behavior and extension selection

When you select behaviors or add extensions from the Cinemachine Camera component, Unity automatically adds extra components to the Cinemachine Camera GameObject. To modify the Cinemachine Camera behavior, you must then edit the properties of these additional components.

> [!NOTE]
> You can get the same result by adding these components manually as any other [GameObject component](https://docs.unity3d.com/Manual/UsingComponents.html).

If no procedural components are present, the Cinemachine Camera controls the Unity Camera position and rotation by its [Transform](https://docs.unity3d.com/Manual/class-Transform.html).

### Custom behaviors and extensions

You can write custom scripts inheriting the `CinemachineComponentBase` or `CinemachineExtension` class to implement your own custom moving behaviors or extensions. When you create such a behavior or extension, it becomes automatically available for selection among the existing ones.

# Cinemachine and Timeline

Use [Timeline](https://docs.unity3d.com/Packages/com.unity.timeline@latest) to activate, deactivate, and blend between CinemachineCameras when you need to produce a predictable shot sequence with choreographed cameras.

**Tip**: For simple shot sequences, you can also use a [Cinemachine Sequencer Camera](CinemachineSequencerCamera.md) instead of Timeline.

## Live Cinemachine Camera selection

When Timeline drives Cinemachine, it overrides the priority-based decisions made by the [Cinemachine Brain](CinemachineBrain.md). When the Timeline finishes, or at least when Timeline is not currently driving Cinemachine, the control [returns to the Cinemachine Brain](concept-camera-control-transitions.md).

## Cinemachine Track and Shot Clips

Timeline controls Cinemachine Cameras via **Cinemachine Shot Clips** in a **Cinemachine Track**. Each shot clip points to a CinemachineCamera to activate and then deactivate. Use a sequence of shot clips to specify the order and duration of each shot.

## Cinemachine Camera transitions

To cut between two CinemachineCameras, place the clips next to each other.

To blend between two CinemachineCameras, overlap the clips.

![Example: Cinemachine Shot Clips in Timeline, with a cut between Shots A-B and a blend between Shots B-C.](images/CinemachineTimelineShotClips.png)

## Multiple Cinemachine Tracks

You can have multiple Cinemachine Tracks in the same Timeline. The tracks lower down in the Timeline override any tracks higher up.

By having a shot on a lower track become active while a higher-up CinemachineShot clip is active, you can interrupt the shot with another one.

It's also possible to have multiple Timelines with Cinemachine tracks.  In this case, the Timeline that was most recently activated overrides the others, with control reverting to the previous Timeline in places where the overriding Timeline has no Cinemachine Camera Clips active.

## Blend with other Cinemachine Tracks and the Brain

You can blend a Cinemachine Shot Clip with another one that is in a separate Cinemachine Track, or even with the Cinemachine Camera currently identified as the Live one by the Cinemachine Brain.

For this, change the **Ease In Duration** and **Ease Out Duration** time values of the clip in the Inspector.

# Cinemachine
Smart camera tools for passionate creators

## About Cinemachine

Cinemachine is a suite of modules for operating the Unity camera. Cinemachine solves the complex mathematics and logic of tracking targets, composing, blending, and cutting between shots. It is designed to significantly reduce the number of time-consuming manual manipulations and script revisions that take place during development.

## Branching Strategy

Cinemachine default branch is main and that’s where the latest version of Cinemachine lives.
For all other minor versions of Cinemachine, a new branch is created under release (e.g. release/2.9, release/2.8). These branches are maintenance branches.

During development, PRs are merged directly on main and maintenance branches. Those branches should always be shippable: the code compiles, features are complete and the CI pipeline is green.

Once a release is done, a branch with the version name is created under releases (e.g. releases/2.9.4, releases/3.0.0-pre.1). No changes are made to those branches. They exist for reference only.

## Release Procedure

Cinemachine is a supported package from Unity, and as such, can be installed from the official registry in the package manager of the Unity editor. The **[Cinemachine Release Procedure](https://docs.google.com/document/d/13K512E28risGGqodOOE3Pb9w5pLmjLhxGzm5r31TuGE/edit?usp=sharing)** is an internal document which contains information to help with the release of a new version of Cinemachine.

# Cinemachine

## What is Cinemachine?
Cinemachine is a suite of ‘smart’ procedural modules which allow you to define the shot and
they’ll dynamically follow your direction. Set up shots which track and compose motion in
realtime, like AI camera operators. The procedural nature makes them bug-resistant as they
always work to make the shot based on your direction. They’re great for gameplay, but they’re
also amazingly fast for cutscenes. Change an animation, a vehicle speed, ground terrain -
whatever - and Cinemachine will dynamically make the shot. You can use really telephoto
lenses and not have to update the cutscene if things change.

## Setup
Cinemachine works out of the box with no dependencies other than Unity itself.
Just install it and you're ready to go.  It's pure c-sharp, fully open-source,
and the public API has complete XML documentation built right in.

## History
Cinemachine has been in development over a number of years across multiple projects. We’ve
been designing camera systems for almost 20 years and have shipped millions of AAA titles
across numerous genres. The Cinemachine team has an award winning cinematographer and
a senior engineer with heavy math skills. Also, we love this stuff to bits.

## Mission
Our mission with Cinemachine is to build an entirely unified camera system bridging
gameplay, cutscenes, from fully procedural cameras to entirely canned sequences and
everything in between.

## Example Scenes
Please have a look at our example scenes. They are shipped with the package and can be imported
via Package Manager.

## Forums
We have a busy discussion area on the forums.

# Cinemachine package

![Unity Cinemachine](images/CinemachineSplash.png)

>[!NOTE]
>To use the Cinemachine package, you must install it separately from the Unity Editor. For detailed information about package requirements and installation instructions, refer to [Installation](InstallationAndUpgrade.md).

Cinemachine is a suite of modules for controlling  the Unity camera. Cinemachine solves the complex mathematics and logic of tracking targets, composing, blending, and cutting between shots. It is designed to significantly reduce the number of time-consuming manual manipulations and script revisions that take place during development.

The procedural nature of these modules makes Cinemachine robust and forgiving. When you make adjustments - for example, change an animation, vehicle speed, terrain, or other GameObjects in your Scene - Cinemachine dynamically adjusts its behavior to make the best shot. There is no need, for example, to re-write camera scripts just because a character turns left instead of right.

Cinemachine works in real time across all genres including FPS, third person, 2D, side-scroller, top down, and RTS. It supports as many shots in your Scene as you need. Its modular system lets you compose sophisticated behaviors.

Cinemachine works well with other Unity tools, acting as a powerful complement to Timeline, animation, and post-processing assets. Create your own [extensions](concept-procedural-motion.md#extensions) or integrate it with your custom camera scripts.

# 2D graphics

Cinemachine supports orthographic cameras. When you set the Unity camera's projection to Orthographic, Cinemachine adjusts to accommodate it. In CinemachineCamera properties for __Lens__, __FOV__ is replaced by __Orthographic Size__. Note that settings related to FOV and certain FOV-oriented behaviors such as [Follow Zoom](CinemachineFollowZoom.md) have no effect if the camera is orthographic.

In orthographic environments, it doesn’t usually make sense to rotate the camera. Accordingly, Cinemachine provides the [Position Composer](CinemachinePositionComposer.md) to handle framing and composition without rotating the camera.

When the main camera has a Pixel Perfect component, you can add a The [Cinemachine Pixel Perfect extension](CinemachinePixelPerfect.md) to your CinemachineCamera to enable it to play well with the Pixel Perfect environment.

To confine the camera to a specific region of your 2D world, you can use the [Cinemachine Confiner 2D extension](CinemachineConfiner2D.md)

# Cinemachine Auto Focus

This CinemachineCamera extension drives the Camera's focusDistance property.  It can be used to lock focus onto a specific object, or (in HDRP) to auto-detect what is in front of the camera and focus on that.

FocusDistance is only relevant for physical cameras, and appropriate processing must be installed for it to have any visible effect.

As of this writing, only HDRP provides out-of-the-box handling to process the Camera's focusDistance.  In HDRP:
1. Create an active Volume containing a Depth Of Field override.
1. In the DepthOfField override, activate Focus Mode and set it to Physical Camera.
1. In the DepthOfField override, activate Focus Distance Mode and set to Camera.

With these settings, the focus distance set by Cinemachine Auto Focus will have a visible effect while the camera is within the Volume.

![Example Auto Vocus Volume](images/CinemachineAutoVocusVolume.png)


## Properties:

| **Property:** || **Function:** |
|:---|:---|:---|
| __FocusTarget__ || The camera's focus distance will be set to the distance from camera to the selected target.  The Focus Offset field will then modify that distance.  |
| | _None_ | Focus tracking is disabled. |
| | _LookAtTarget_ | Focus offset is relative to the LookAt target. |
| | _FollowTarget_ | Focus offset is relative to the Follow target. |
| | _CustomTarget_ | Focus offset is relative to the Custom target set in the _CustomTarget_ field. |
| | _Camera_ | Focus offset is relative to the camera.  Use this setting to directly set the focus distance using _FocusDepthOffset_. |
| | _ScreenCenter_ | HDRP only: Focus will be on whatever is located in the depth buffer at the center of the screen. |
| __Custom Target__ || The target to use if Focus Target is set to _CustomTarget_.  |
| __Focus Depth Offset__ || Offsets the sharpest point away in depth from the focus target location.  |
| __Damping__ || The value corresponds approximately to the time the focus will take to adjust to the new value.  |
| __Auto Detection Radius__ || HDRP-only: Radius of the AutoFocus sensor in the center of the screen, used when _Focus Target_ is set to _ScreenCenter_.  A value of 1 would fill the screen.  It's recommended to keep this quite small.  Default value is 0.02.  |

# Cinemachine Basic Multi Channel Perlin component

Use a Basic Multi Channel Perlin component in a Cinemachine Camera GameObject to simulate camera shake via Perlin noise movement. Perlin noise is a technique to compute pseudo-random movement with a natural behavior.

The Basic Multi Channel Perlin component applies a [Noise Profile Asset](CinemachineNoiseProfiles.md) which defines the noise behavior over time. Cinemachine includes a few noise profile assets. You can edit them and create your own ones.

<!--- Update the screenshot below, it should show the actual component --->

![Choosing the Basic Multi Channel Perlin component to add camera noise](images/CinemachineBasicMultiChannelPerlin.png)
--->

## Properties

| **Property:** | **Function:** |
|:---|:---|
| **Noise Profile** | The noise profile asset to use.|
| **Amplitude Gain** | Gain to apply to the amplitudes defined in the noise profile. Use 1 to use the amplitudes defined in the noise profile. Setting this to 0 mutes the noise. Tip: Animate this property to ramp the noise effect up and down.|
| **Frequency Gain** | Factor to apply to the frequencies defined in the noise profile. Use 1 to use the frequencies defined in the noise profile. Use larger values to shake the camera more rapidly. Tip: Animate this property to ramp the noise effect up and down. |
| **Pivot Offset** | When rotating the camera, offset the camera's pivot by the indicated x, y, and z distance when applying rotational noise. This generates some positional variation that corresponds to the rotation noise. |

# Cinemachine Blender Settings asset

Use a Cinemachine Blender Settings asset from the [Cinemachine Brain component](CinemachineBrain.md) to define **Custom Blends** (overriding the **Default Blend** setting) between specific pairs of Cinemachine Cameras.

For more information about blends, refer to [Camera control and transitions](concept-camera-control-transitions.md).

![Custom Blends list in Cinemachine Brain](images/CinemachineCustomBlends.png)

The __From__ and __To__ settings are name-based, not references. This means that Cinemachine finds cameras by matching their names to the settings. They are not linked to specific GameObjects.  The built-in dropdowns can be used to select a CinemachineCamera from the current scene, or the name can be typed directly into the text boxes.  If a name does not match any CinemachineCamera in the current scene, the field will be highlighted in yellow.

Use the reserved name **\*\*ANY CAMERA\*\*** to blend from or to any CinemachineCamera.

When Cinemachine begins a transition from one CinemachineCamera to another, it will look in this asset for an entry that matches the upcoming transition, and apply that blend definition.

- If none is found, then the CinemachineBrain's DefaultBlend setting will apply.
- If multiple entries in the Custom Blends asset match the upcoming transition, Cinemachine will choose the one with the strongest specificity. For example, if blending from vcam1 to vcam2, and the custom blends asset contains an entry for _vcam1-to-AnyCamera_, and another entry for _vcam1-to-vcam2_, then the _vcam1-to-vcam2_ entry will apply.
- If multiple entries in the Custom Blends asset match the upcoming transition with equally-strong specificity, then the first one found will apply.

## Properties:

| **Property:** || **Function:** |
|:---|:---|:---|
| __From__ || The name of the CinemachineCamera to blend from. Use the name \*\*ANY CAMERA\*\* to blend from any CinemachineCamera. This property is available only for custom blends. |
| __To__ || The name of the CinemachineCamera to blend to. Use the name \*\*ANY CAMERA\*\* to blend to any CinemachineCamera. This property is available only for custom blends. |
| __Style Default Blend__ || Shape of the blend curve. |
| | _Cut_ | Zero-length blend. |
| | _Ease In Out_ | S-shaped curve, giving a gentle and smooth transition. |
| | _Ease In_ | Linear out of the outgoing CinemachineCamera, and ease into the incoming CinemachineCamera. |
| | _Ease Out_ | Ease out of the outgoing CinemachineCamera, and blend linearly into the incoming CinemachineCamera. |
| | _Hard In_ | Ease out of the outgoing CinemachineCamera, and accelerate into the incoming CinemachineCamera. |
| | _Hard Out_ | Accelerate out of the outgoing CinemachineCamera, and ease into the incoming CinemachineCamera. |
| | _Linear_ | Linear blend. mechanical-looking. |
| | _Custom_ | Custom blend curve. Allows you to draw a custom blend curve. |
| __Time__ || Duration (in seconds) of the blend. |

# Cinemachine Brain component

The Cinemachine Brain is a component in the Unity camera itself. Cinemachine Brain monitors all active [**CinemachineCameras**](CinemachineCamera.md) in the Scene. It chooses the next CinemachineCamera to control the Unity camera. It also controls the [transition (cut or blend)](concept-camera-control-transitions.md) from the current CinemachineCamera to the next.

Objects with a Cinemachine Brain are displayed in the hierarchy with a little CinemachineCamera icon next to them.  You can turn that off from the Cinemachine Preferences panel.

To add a Cinemachine Brain component to a Unity camera, do __one__ of the following:

* Use the GameObject > Cinemachine menu to add a CinemachineCamera to your Scene. Unity adds a Cinemachine Brain component to the Unity camera for you if there isn’t one already.

* [Add](https://docs.unity3d.com/Manual/UsingComponents.html) a Cinemachine Brain component to the Unity camera yourself.

You can also control CinemachineCameras from [Timeline](concept-timeline.md). Timeline overrides the decisions that Cinemachine Brain would otherwise make.

Cinemachine Brain holds the following key properties:

* __Blend Settings__: A list that defines how to blend from one CinemachineCamera to another.  For example, add an item to the list for a 4 second blend from vcam1 to vcam2 then add another item for a 1 second blend from vcam2 back to vcam1. If a blend between two cameras isn’t defined, Cinemachine Brain uses its default blend.

* __Channel Filter__:  Cinemachine Brain uses only those CinemachineCameras that output to Channels present in the Channel Mask.  You can set up [split-screen environments](CinemachineMultipleCameras.md) by using the Channel Mask to filter channels.

* __Event Dispatching__:  Cinemachine Brain fires events when it changes shot. It fires an event when a CinemachineCamera goes live. It also fires an event when it cuts from one CinemachineCamera to another. Use the latter event to reset temporal post effects.

![Cinemachine Brain, a component in the Unity camera](images/CinemachineBrainInspector.png)

## Properties:

| **Property:** || **Function:** |
|:---|:---|:---|
| __Show Debug Text__ || Check to display a textual summary of the live CinemachineCamera and blend in the view. |
| __Show Camera Frustum__ || Check to display the frustum of the camera in the Scene view. |
| __Ignore Time Scale__ || Check to make the CinemachineCameras respond in real time to user input and damping, even if the game is running in slow motion. |
| __World Up Override__ || The Y axis of the specified GameObject defines the worldspace up vector for CinemachineCameras. Use this property in top-down game environments. Set to None to use the worldspace Y axis. Setting this appropriately is important to avoid gimbal-lock in extreme up/down conditions. |
| __Channel Mask__ || The CinemachineBrain will find the highest-priority CinemachineCamera that outputs to any of the channels selected. CinemachineCameras that do not output to one of these channels will be ignored.  Normally, this value should be left at Default.  Change it in situations where multiple CinemachineBrains are needed (for example, when implementing Split-screen). |
| __Update Method__ || When to update the position and rotation of the CinemachineCameras.  |
| | _Fixed Update_ | Synchronize CinemachineCamera update with the Physics module, in FixedUpdate. |
| | _Late Update_ | In MonoBehaviour LateUpdate. |
| | _Smart Update_ | Update each CinemachineCamera according to how its target is updated. This is the recommended setting. |
| | _Manual Update_ | CinemachineCameras do not update automatically.  You must explicitly call `brain.ManualUpdate()` at an appropriate time in your game loop.  This should be after any camera LookAt or Follow targets have moved.  This is an advanced feature. |
| __Blend Update Method__ || When to resolve the blends and update the main camera.  |
| | _Late Update_ | In MonoBehaviour LateUpdate. This is the recommended setting. |
| | _Fixed Update_ | Use this setting only if your Update Method is FixedUpdate and you see judder when blending. |
| __Lens Mode Override__ || When enabled, CM camras are permitted to override the camera's lens mode (Perspective vs Orthographic vs Physical).  |
| __Default Mode__ || When Lens Mode Override is enabled and there is no CinemachineCamera actively overriding the lens mode, this lens mode will be pushed to the camera. |
| | _None_ | If Lens Override Mode is enabled and Default Mode is set to _None_, there will be no default mode pushed to the Camera when the CinemachineCamera is not overriding the lens mode.  This setting is not recommended, because it can produce unpredictable results.  It's always best to have a default mode. |
| | _Orthographic_ | Sets the __Projection__ property to __Orthographic__. |
| | _Perspective_ | Sets the __Projection__ property to __Perspective__ and *disables* the __Physical Camera__ feature and properties. |
| | _Physical_ | Sets the __Projection__ property to __Perspective__ and *enables* the __Physical Camera__ feature and properties. |
| __Default Blend__ || The blend to use when you haven’t explicitly defined a blend between two CinemachineCameras. |
| | _Cut_ | Zero-length blend. |
| | _Ease In Out_ | S-shaped curve, giving a gentle and smooth transition. |
| | _Ease In_ | Linear out of the outgoing shot, and easy into the incoming. |
| | _Ease Out_ | Easy out of the outgoing shot, and linear into the incoming. |
| | _Hard In_ | Easy out of the outgoing, and hard into the incoming. |
| | _Hard Out_ | Hard out of the outgoing, and easy into the incoming. |
| | _Linear_ | Linear blend. Mechanical-looking. |
| | _Custom_ | Custom blend curve. Draw the curve you want. |
| __Custom Blends__ || The asset that contains custom settings for blends between specific CinemachineCameras in your Scene. |
| __Create Asset__ || Create an asset containing a [list of custom blends](CinemachineBlending.md) between CinemachineCameras.  |
| __Camera Cut Event__ || This event fires when a CinemachineCamera goes live and there is no blend.  |
| __Camera Activated Event__ || This event fires when a CinemachineCamera goes live. If a blend is involved, then the event fires on the first frame of the blend. |
