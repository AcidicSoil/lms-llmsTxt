# Visualeffectgraph Samples

> The purpose of this project is to provide developers with sample scenes and visual effects built using Unity’s Visual Effect Graph system. These samples demonstrate the capabilities of VFX in creating dynamic, high-performance visual effects such as fire, smoke, particle trails, volumetric lighting, and more — all optimized for modern rendering pipelines like HD Render Pipeline (HDRP). The project also includes tools and UI components to manage and toggle these effects, making it ideal for learning, prototyping, or integrating into games and simulations.

**Remember:**
- Visual Effect Graph (VFX)
- HD Render Pipeline
- Shader Graphs for Visual Effects
- Particle Systems & Simulation
- Volumetric Lighting & Transmission
- Animation and Tweening Effects
