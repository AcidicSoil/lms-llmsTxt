# Set up your project for the BatchRendererGroup API

Before you use BRG, your project must support it. BRG requires your project to:

* Use the SRP Batcher. To enable the SRP Batcher, see [Using the SRP Batcher](SRPBatcher.md#using-the-srp-batcher).
* Keep BRG [shader variants](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/Manual/shader-variants). To do this, select **Edit** > **Project Settings** > **Graphics**, and set **BatchRendererGroup variants** to **Keep all**.
* Allow [unsafe code](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/csharp/language-reference/unsafe-code). To do this, enable the **Allow ‘unsafe’ Code** [Player Setting](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/Manual/class-PlayerSettings).

**Note:** The BatchRendererGroup uses [DOTS Instancing shaders](dots-instancing-shaders.md), but it doesn't require any DOTS packages. The name reflects the new data-oriented way to load instance data, and also helps with backward compatibility with existing Hybrid Renderer compatible shaders.

For information on how to use BRG to create a basic renderer, see [Creating a renderer with BatchRendererGroup](batch-renderer-group-creating-a-renderer.md).

# Install HDRP 

Create a new project



## Create a HDRP Project from the template

To set up and manage your Unity Projects, install the [Unity Hub](https://docs.unity3d.com/hub/manual/index.html).

Unity provides an HDRP Template Project which you can use to get set up with HDRP. To create an HDRP Template Project:

1. Open the Unity Hub,
2. Go to **Projects**, and select **New Project**.
3. Open the **Sample** tab and select **3D Sample Scene (HDRP)**.
4. Enter a **Project name**.
5. Select **Create project**.

Unity creates a Project and automatically installs the HDRP package, and all its dependencies. After Unity opens the Template Project, you can see the main Scene.

![A contemporary room brightly lit by a skylight, with a display of vegetation in a glass box.](Images/GettingStarted1.png)

This template is a great starting point for projects aiming for high-end graphics. It includes multiple physically based lighting setups to help you realistically illuminate environments with HDRP. It also includes examples for many of HDRP's features such as [Decals](decals.md), [Volumes](understand-volumes.md), and physically accurate Materials.

## Install the High Definition RP package

To install HDRP, add the High Definition RP package to your Unity Project:

1. Open your Unity project.
2. To open the **Package Manager** window, go to **Window** > **Package Management** > **Package Manager**.
3. In the **Package Manager** window, in the **Packages:** field, select **Unity Registry** from the menu.
4. Select **High Definition RP** from the list of packages.
5. In the bottom right corner of the Package Manager window, select **Install**.

**Note**: To fix any errors that appear, use the [HDRP Wizard](Render-Pipeline-Wizard.md).

# Install Shader Graph

Learn about the Shader Graph installation requirements and follow the installation instructions.

## Requirements

Use Shader Graph with either of the Scriptable Render Pipelines (SRPs) available in Unity version 2018.1 and later:

- The [High Definition Render Pipeline (HDRP)](https://docs.unity3d.com/Packages/com.unity.render-pipelines.high-definition@latest)
- The [Universal Render Pipeline (URP)](https://docs.unity3d.com/Manual/urp/urp-introduction.html)

As of Unity version 2021.2, you can also use Shader Graph with the [Built-In Render Pipeline](https://docs.unity3d.com/Documentation/Manual/built-in-render-pipeline.html).

> [!NOTE]
> - Shader Graph support for the Built-In Render Pipeline is for compatibility purposes only. Shader Graph doesn't receive updates for Built-In Render Pipeline support, aside from bug fixes for existing features. It's recommended to use Shader Graph with the Scriptable Render Pipelines.
> - In the Built-In Render Pipeline, Shader Graph doesn't support XR.
> - In the Built-In Render Pipeline, GPU Instancing doesn't work with Shader Graph shaders.
> - In URP and HDRP, GPU instancing works with custom shaders only if you disable the [Scriptable Render Pipeline (SRP) Batcher](SRPBatcher) or [make a shader incompatible with the SRP Batcher](SRPBatcher-Incompatible).

## Installation

When you install HDRP or URP into your project, Unity also installs the Shader Graph package automatically. You can manually install Shader Graph for use with the Built-In Render Pipeline on Unity version 2021.2 and later with the Package Manager.

* For more information about how to install a package, see [Adding and removing packages](https://docs.unity3d.com/Manual/upm-ui-actions.html) in the Unity User Manual.

* For more information about how to set up a Scriptable Render Pipeline, see [Getting started with HDRP](https://docs.unity3d.com/Packages/com.unity.render-pipelines.high-definition@17.0/manual/getting-started-in-hdrp.html) or [Getting started with URP](https://docs.unity3d.com/Manual/urp/InstallingAndConfiguringURP).

# Set up ray tracing

The High Definition Render Pipeline (HDRP) includes preview ray tracing support from Unity 2019.3. Ray tracing allows you to access data that's not on screen. For example, you can use it to request position data, normal data, or lighting data, and then use this data to compute quantities that are hard to approximate using classic rasterization techniques.

For information about the hardware ray tracing requires, refer to [Ray tracing hardware requirements](raytracing-requirements.md)

## Integrate ray tracing into your HDRP Project

Before you use ray tracing features in your HDRP Project, you need to set up your HDRP Project for ray tracing support. HDRP only supports ray tracing using the DirectX 12 API, so ray tracing only works in the Unity Editor or the Windows Unity Player when they render with DirectX 12. You need to change the default graphics API of your HDRP project from DirectX 11 to DirectX 12.

There are two ways to do this:

* [Use the Render Pipeline Wizard](#WizardSetup)

* [Manual setup](#ManualSetup)

Once you have completed one of these, move onto [Final setup](#final-setup).

<a name="WizardSetup"></a>

### Render Pipeline Wizard setup

You can use the [Render Pipeline Wizard](Render-Pipeline-Wizard.md) to set up ray tracing in your HDRP Project.

1. To open the HDRP Wizard, go to **Window** > **Rendering** > **HDRP Wizard**.

2. Select the **HDRP + DXR** tab.

3. Click the **Fix All** button.

To enable ray tracing for specific effects, enable the ray tracing features in the [HDRP Asset](#ManualSetup-EnableAssetFeatures).

For information on how to set up ray tracing for your Scene, see [final setup](#final-setup).

<a name="ManualSetup"></a>

### Manual setup

To set up ray tracing manually, you need to:

1. [Make your HDRP project use DirectX 12](#ManualSetup-EnablingDX12).
2. [Disable static batching on your HDRP project](#ManualSetup-DisablingStaticBatching).
3. [Enable and configure ray tracing in your HDRP Asset](#ManualSetup-EnablingRayTracing).
4. [Ensure ray tracing resources are properly assigned](#ManualSetup-RayTracingResources).
5. (Optional) [Enable ray-traced effects in your HDRP Asset](#ManualSetup-EnableAssetFeatures).

<a name="ManualSetup-EnablingDX12"></a>

#### Upgrade to DirectX 12

In Unity 6, DirectX 12 is enabled by default.

To enable DirectX 12 manually:

1. Go to **Edit** > **Project Settings** > **Player** > **Other Settings**.

1. In the **Rendering** section, disable **Auto Graphics API for Windows**.

	This exposes the Graphics APIs for Windows section.

1. Make sure **Direct3D12** is at the top of the list.

	If you made any changes to the rendering settings, you might be prompted to restart the Unity Editor.

<a name="ManualSetup-DisablingStaticBatching"></a>

#### Disable static batching

Next, you need to disable static batching, because HDRP doesn't support this feature with ray tracing in **Play Mode**. To do this:

1. Open the Project Settings window (menu:  **Edit** > **Project Settings**), then select the **Player** tab.
2. Select the **Other Settings** drop-down, then in the **Rendering** section, disable **Static Batching**.

<a name="ManualSetup-EnablingRayTracing"></a>

#### Enable ray tracing in the HDRP Asset 

Now that Unity is running in DirectX 12, and you have disabled [static batching](https://docs.unity3d.com/Manual/DrawCallBatching.html), enable and configure ray tracing in your [HDRP Asset](HDRP-Asset.md). The previous steps configured Unity to support ray tracing; the following step enables it in your HDRP Unity Project.

1. Click on your HDRP Asset in the Project window to view it in the Inspector.
2. In the **Rendering** section, enable **Realtime Ray Tracing**. This triggers a recompilation, which makes ray tracing available in your HDRP Project.

<a name="ManualSetup-RayTracingResources"></a>

#### Verify ray tracing resources

To verify that HDRP has assigned ray tracing resources:

1. Open the Project Settings window (menu: **Edit** > **Project Settings**), then select the **HDRP Default Settings** tab.
2. Find the **Render Pipeline Resources** field and make sure there is a Render Pipeline Resources Asset assigned to it.

<a name="ManualSetup-EnableAssetFeatures"></a>

#### Enable ray-traced effects in the HDRP Asset (Optional)

HDRP uses ray tracing to replace certain rasterized effects. To use a ray tracing effect in your Project, you must first enable the rasterized version of the effect. The four effects that require you to modify your HDRP Asset  are:

* **Screen Space Shadows**
* **Screen Space Reflections**
*  **Transparent Screen Space Reflections**
* **Screen Space Global Illumination**

To enable the above effects in your HDRP Unity Project:

1. Click on your HDRP Asset in the Project window to view it in the Inspector.
2. Go to **Lighting** > **Reflections** and enable **Screen Space Reflection**.
3. After enabling **Screen Space Reflections**, go to **Lighting** > **Reflections** and enable **Transparent Screen Space Reflection**.
4. Go to **Lighting** > **Shadows** and enable **Screen Space Shadows**.
5. Go to **Lighting** > **Lighting** and enable **Screen Space Global Illumination**.

Your HDRP Project now fully supports ray tracing. For information on how to set up ray tracing for your Scene, see [final setup](#final-setup).

### Final setup

Now that your HDRP Project supports ray tracing, there are steps you must complete to use it in your Scene.

1. [Frame Settings validation](#frame-settings)
2. [Build settings validation](#build-settings)
3. [Scene validation](#scene-validation)


#### Frame Settings

To make HDRP calculate ray tracing effects for [Cameras](hdrp-camera-component-reference.md) in your Scene, make sure your Cameras use [Frame Settings](Frame-Settings.md) that have ray tracing enabled. You can enable ray tracing for all Cameras by default, or you can enable ray tracing for specific Cameras in your Scene.

To enable ray tracing by default:

1. From the main menu, select **Edit** &gt; **Project Settings**.
2. In the **Project Settings** window, go to the **Pipeline Specific Settings** section, then select the **HDRP** tab.
3. Under **Frame Settings (Default Values)** &gt; **Camera** &gt; **Rendering**, enable **Ray Tracing**.

To enable ray tracing for a specific camera:

1. Select the camera in the scene or **Hierarchy** window to view it in the **Inspector** window.
2. In the **Rendering** section, enable **Custom Frame Settings**. This exposes frame settings for this camera only.
3. Use the foldout (triangle) to expand **Rendering**, then enable **Ray Tracing**.

#### Build settings

To build your Project to a Unity Player, ray tracing requires that the build uses 64 bits architecture. To set your build to use 64 bits architecture:

1. Open the Build Settings window (menu: **File > Build Settings**).
2. From the **Architecture** drop-down, select **x86_64**.

#### Scene validation

To check whether it's possible to use ray tracing in a Scene, HDRP includes a menu option that validates each GameObject in the Scene. If you don't setup GameObjects correctly, this process throws warnings in the Console window. For the list of things this option checks for, see [Menu items](Menu-Items.md#other). To use it:
1. Click **Edit** > **Render Pipeline** > **HD Render Pipeline**  > **Check Scene Content for Ray Tracing**.
2. In the Console window (menu: **Window > General > Console**), check if there are any warnings.

<a name="RayTracingMeshes"></a>

## Ray tracing and Meshes

HDRP changes how it handles Meshes in your scene when you integrate a ray traced effect into your project.

When you enable ray tracing, HDRP automatically creates a ray tracing acceleration structure. This structure allows Unity to calculate ray tracing for Meshes in your scene efficiently in real time.

As a result, ray tracing can change how some Meshes appear in your scene in the following ways:

- If your Mesh has a Material assigned that doesn't have the HDRenderPipeline tag, HDRP doesn't add it to the acceleration structure and doesn't apply any ray traced effects to the mesh as a result.
- If a Mesh has a combination of Materials that are single and double-sided, HDRP flags all Materials you have assigned to this mesh as double-sided.

To include a GameObject in ray tracing effects, adjust the Ray Tracing settings in the GameObject's [Mesh Renderer component](https://docs.unity3d.com/Manual/class-MeshRenderer.html#ray-tracing).

## Ray tracing light culling
Ray tracing requires HDRP to cull lights differently to how it culls lights for rasterization. With rasterization, only lights that affect the current frustum matter. Since ray tracing uses off-screen data for effects such as reflection, HDRP needs to consider lights that affect off screen geometry. For this reason, HDRP defines a range around the camera where it gathers light. To control this range, use the [Light Cluster](Ray-Tracing-Light-Cluster.md) Volume override. It's important to set a range that accurately represents the environment scale. A higher range makes HDRP include lights further away, but it also increases the resource intensity of light culling for ray tracing.

## Ray tracing mode
HDRP includes two ray tracing modes that define how it evaluates certain ray-traced effects. The modes are:

* **Performance**: This mode targets real-time applications. If you select this mode, ray-traced effects include presets that you can change to balance performance with quality.
* **Quality**: This mode targets technical demos and applications that want the best quality results.

HDRP exposes different properties for some ray-traced effects based on the ray tracing mode you use..

You can change which ray tracing mode HDRP uses on either a Project level or effect level. To change the ray tracing mode for your entire Project:

1. Click on your [HDRP Asset](HDRP-Asset.md) in the Project window to view it in the Inspector.
2. In the **Rendering** section, enable the **Realtime Raytracing** checkbox, open the **Supported Ray Tracing Mode** drop-down and select a ray tracing mode from open.

If you select the **Both** option, you can change the ray tracing mode for each ray-traced effect. To do this:

1. In the Scene or Hierarchy view, select a GameObject that contains a Volume component that includes a ray-traced effect.
2. In the Inspector for the ray-traced effect, change the **Mode** property to use the ray tracing mode you want the effect to use. This changes the properties available in the Inspector.


## Ray tracing project

You can find a ray tracing project that contains all the effects mentioned above in the [Small Office Ray Tracing sample project](https://github.com/Unity-Technologies/SmallOfficeRayTracing).
This Project is already set up with ray tracing support.

## Limitations
### Platform support

HDRP supports ray tracing for DirectX 12 and specific console platforms. Consult console-specific documentation for more information.

### Feature compatibility

HDRP ray tracing in Unity isn't compatible with the following features:

- Vertex animation, for example wind deformation of vegetation.
- Emissive [Decals](decals.md). To disable emission, go to the [Decal Material Inspector window](decal-material-inspector-reference.md) and disable **Affect Emissive**.
- Ray tracing is not compatible with the detail meshes and trees in the [Terrain system](https://docs.unity3d.com/Manual/script-Terrain.html). It is compatible with terrain geometry. To include detailed meshes and trees in ray traced reflections, use [mixed tracing](Override-Screen-Space-Reflection.md#mixed-tracing).
- Volumetric [fog](create-a-local-fog-effect.md).
- [Tessellation](Tessellation.md).
- Per-pixel displacement techniques such as parallax occlusion mapping, depth offset, and non-terrain height maps.
- MSAA.
- [Graphics.DrawMesh](https://docs.unity3d.com/ScriptReference/Graphics.DrawMesh.html) or [Graphics.RenderMesh](https://docs.unity3d.com/ScriptReference/Graphics.RenderMesh.html), because rasterization and ray tracing are different ways of generating an image.
- [Orthographic projection](hdrp-camera-component-reference.md). If you enable orthographic projection mode, you might experience rendering problems with transparent materials, volumetrics, and planar reflections.
- Ray Traced and Screen Space effects. These don't appear recursively in [Ray Traced Reflections](Ray-Traced-Reflections.md), [Ray Traced Global Illumination](Ray-Traced-Global-Illumination.md) or [Recursive Ray Tracing](Ray-Tracing-Recursive-Rendering.md). This means, for example, you can't see [Screen Space Global Illumination](Override-Screen-Space-GI.md) in [ray-traced reflections](Ray-Traced-Reflections.md).
- Fully accurate shadow culling. You might see missing shadows in ray-traced effects. You can use **Extend Shadow Culling** to improve accuracy. See [Ray Tracing Settings](Ray-Tracing-Settings.md) for more information.
- Data-Oriented Technology Stack (DOTS)
- Entity Component System (ECS)
- Water

#### Reflection Probes

Although ray-traced rendering results include data from [Reflection Probes](Reflection-Probe.md), Reflection Probes do not capture geometry that HDRP renders with ray tracing.

### Unsupported shader graph nodes for ray tracing

When building your custom shaders using shader graph, some nodes are incompatible with ray tracing. You need either to avoid using them or provide an alternative behavior using the [ray tracing shader node](SGNode-Raytracing-Quality.md). Here is the list of the incompatible nodes:
- DDX, DDY and DDXY nodes, and NormalFromHeight nodes.
- All the nodes under **Inputs** > **Geometry** (Position, View Direction, Normal, etc.) in View Space mode.
Furthermore, Shader Graphs that use [Custom Interpolators](https://docs.unity3d.com/Packages/com.unity.shadergraph@latest/index.html?subfolder=/manual/Custom-Interpolators.html) aren't supported in ray tracing.

### Unsupported features of path tracing

For information about unsupported features of path tracing, see [Path tracing limitations](path-tracing-limitations.md).

# Example Custom Render Texture with Shader Graph

This example demonstrates how to set up a Shader Graph for Custom Render Texture shaders to create a self-healing deformation effect that could be used for snow, sand, etc.

<video src="Images/CustomRenderTexture-Animation.mp4" title="A grid with various cells labeled with letter-number pairs (for example, A0, B1, G2, and so on), accompanied by arrows. Each cell is a different color. In the upper-left corner, there’s a black square with two red spots, one square and the other circular. The square remains stationary, while the circular spot traces a curve. In the upper-right corner, a black square contains the same glowing red spots, with the circular spot leaving a fading trail as it describes a curve. Above the grid, a cube corresponding to the square floats and leaves a hollow imprint behind, as if the grid were a mattress pressed by a heavy object. A red sphere traces the same curve as the circular spot, creating a furrow in the grid. The grid gradually recovers its original shape, and the furrow disappears." width="700" height="auto" autoplay="true" loop="true" controls></video>



For this effect, we need a Render Texture that contains the pixels we want to displace. This Render Texture is displayed at the top left corner of the preceding image. It was directly assigned to a camera that renders the objects in red above the UV plane.

1. Create a **Custom Render Texture** Shader Graph as follows:
   - Right-click in the Project window.
   - Select **Create** > **Shader Graph** > **Custom Render Texture** and name your shader.

2. Create a new **Custom Render Texture** as follows: 
    - Select **Create** > **Rendering** > **Custom Render Texture**. 
    - Configure the parameters to match the following settings:
      - **Dimension**: 2D
      - **Size**: 1024 x 1024
      - **Anti-aliasing**: None
      - **Enable Compatible Format**: selected
      - **Color Format**: R32_SFLOAT
      - **Depth Stencil Format**: None
      - **Mipmap**: not selected
      - **Dynamic Scaling**: not selected
      - **Random Write**: not selected
      - **Wrap Mode**: Clamp
      - **Filter Mode**: Bilinear
      - **Aniso Level**: 0
      - **Material**: SnowHeightmapUpdate
    **Note**: The material in the **Material** field was created.
      - **Shader Pass**: <Unnamed Pass 0>
      - **Initialization Mode**: OnDemand
      - **Source**: Texture and Color
      - **Color**: select a color
      - **Texture**: None (Texture)
      - **Update Mode**: Realtime
      - **Period**: 0
      - **Double Buffered**: selected
      - **Wrap Update Zones**: not selected
      - **Update Zone Space**: Normalized
      - **Update Zones**: list empty

The following Shader Graph reads the output of the Camera Render Texture, as well as the Self texture, then adds them and lerps the result so that it tends towards 0 over time. 

![The graph that is described in the preceding text.](images/CustomRenderTextureShaderGraph.png)

3. Finally you need to assign the **Custom Render Texture** to a material that can deform the geometry (tessellation or pixel displacement).

## New ShaderGraph Nodes for Custom Render Textures

Three new ShaderGraph nodes have been introduced to facilitate working with Custom Render Textures:

1. [Custom Render Texture Self](Custom-Texture-Self.md)
   - Outputs the double-buffered texture from the previous update.
   - It provides three outputs for different types of textures: 2D, 3D, and Cube textures.

2. [Custom Render Texture Size](Custom-Texture-Size.md)
   - Outputs the width, height, and volume depth of the current Custom Render Texture.
   - Use this node to determine the size of the texture being worked with.

3. [Custom Render Texture Slice](Custom-Texture-Slice.md)
   - Outputs the current slice for 2D Texture Arrays or the Cubemap face index being updated.

## Known Limitations

When working with Custom Render Texture shaders, be aware of the following limitations:

* Rendering Order
   - The Custom Render Texture update loop runs before any rendering operations. This means:
      - You cannot access any render pipeline-specific information in the shader, such as depth, normal, or scene color.
      - Despite this, you can rely on the content of the Custom Render Texture being ready for use in the scene when the camera renders.

The goal of this sample pack is to help users see what is required to achieve specific effects and provide examples to make it easier for users to learn.

The sample content is broken into the following categories:

 - **Blending Masks** - these samples generate masks based on characteristics of the surface - such as height, facing angle, or distance from the camera.
 - **Custom Interpolator** - here we show how to use the Custom Interpolator feature in Shader Graph to move calculations from the fragment stage to the vertex stage to save performance.
 - **Detail Mapping** - techniques for adding additional detail to a surface that isn’t contained in the base set of texture maps.
 - **Procedural Noise and Shapes** - methods for creating shapes or patterns that use math instead of texture samples.
 - **Shader Graph Feature Examples** - examples of using specific Shader Graph features - such as the Custom Code node or the Custom Interpolator
 - **UV Projection** - methods of creating texture coordinates to achieve specific effects such as parallax occlusion mapping, or triplanar projection
 - **Vertex Animation** - techniques for adjusting the position of the vertices to create effects such as waves, animated flags, or camera-facing billboards.
 - **Particles** - shows how a full-featured particle system can be built using just Shader Graph
 - **Conditions** - demonstrates branching based on graphics quality setting and based on the active render pipeline.
 - **Custom Lighting** - shows how Shader Graph can be used to build custom lighting models - including PBR, simple, and cel shading.

## Blend Masks
A major part of creating shaders is determining where specific effects should be applied. This is done by creating a mask and then using the mask to separate areas where the effect should be applied versus where it should not be applied.  This set of samples provides examples of various methods of creating these masks.

#### Altitude Mask
The Altitude Mask is black below the minimum altitude, transitions from black to white between the minimum and maximum altitudes, and then stays white above the maximum altitude. You can use the AltitudeMask subgraph to create this effect.

The Altitude Mask example shows how to use the Altitude Mask subgraph in the shader to blend between two materials. Below the minimum altitude, the cobblestones material is used.  Between minimum and maximum, the materials blend from cobblestones to gold, and then above the maximum, the gold material is used.

You can use the Falloff Type dropdown on the Altitude subgraph node to select the type of blend ramp to use. Linear will make the mask a direct line from minimum to maximum, while Smoothstep will create smooth transitions using a more S shaped curve.

#### Angle Mask
The Angle Mask uses the direction that a surface is facing to determine if the mask should be black or white. If the surface is pointing in the direction of the given input vector, the mask is white.  If it’s pointing away from the given vector, the mask is black.

The Angle Mask example uses the AngleMask subgraph to generate a mask, and then the mask is used to blend between the cobblestones material and a white, snow-like material.

In this example, the AngleMask subgraph node’s MaskVector input is set to 0,1,0 - which is a vector pointing in the up direction (positive Y). When the object’s surface is pointing in that direction, the mask is white.  When the surface is pointing away from that direction, the mask is black.

The Max and Min input values on the AngleMask subgraph are used to control the falloff of the mask. Both values should use numbers between zero and one.  When the Max and Min values are close together (0.5 and 0.48 for example), the falloff will be sharper. When they’re farther apart (0.8 and 0.3 for example), the falloff will be more gradual and blurry. When Max and Min are closer to a value of 1, the surface direction must match the MaskVector much more closely for the mask to be white.  When Max and Min are closer to a value of zero, the mask will be white even with a larger difference between the surface direction and the MaskVector.

#### Camera Distance Mask
The Camera Distance Mask uses the distance from the camera location to the object’s surface to determine if the mask should be black or white. When the camera is close to the surface, the mask is black and when it’s further away, the mask is white.

In this example, we apply the cobblestones material when the camera is close to the object and as the camera moves away we blend to the gold material.

The Start Distance and Length values on the CameraDistanceMask subgraph control how the mask functions.  The Start Distance value controls where the mask starts the transition from black to white.  In this case, it’s set to 2 meters - which means that between 0 and 2 meters, the mask will be black.  The Length value controls how long the transition is between black and white.  In this case, it’s also set to 2 meters, so from a 2 meter distance to a 4 meter distance the mask will transition from black to white.  Any distance beyond 4 meters will create a white mask.
#### Height Mask
The Height Mask uses the material height data of two materials to blend them together, creating a much more realistic looking intersection between them. Instead of fading between two materials, we can apply one material in the cracks and crevices of the other.

In this example, we use U texture coordinate as a smooth gradient mask, and then modify the mask using the heights of the two materials. Instead of a smooth blend, we end up with the gold material being applied in the lower areas of the cobblestones first and then gradually rising until just the tops of the cobblestones show before being replaced completely by the gold.

In order for this effect to work correctly, one or both of the materials need good height data. This type of a transition works best on materials with varying heights - like the cobblestones.  Materials that are mostly flat won’t generate interesting effects with this technique.

## Custom Interpolator
The Custom Interpolator feature in Shader Graph allows you to do any type of calculation in the Vertex Stage and then interpolate the results to be used in the Fragment Stage.  Doing calculations in the Vertex Stage can give a major performance boost since math is only done once per vertex instead of for every pixel.

However, per-vertex calculations can cause artifacts as illustrated in the Artifacts example.  Be careful to only do math with low-frequency variations to avoid these artifacts.

#### Interpolation Artifacts
This example shows the types of artifacts that can occur when we do math in the vertex stage. In order to be smooth, lighting needs to be calculated at each pixel - but here we’re doing the calculations per-vertex instead and then interpolating the results to the pixels.  The interpolation is linear, so we don’t get enough accuracy and the result looks angular and jagged instead of smooth - especially on the specular highlight.
#### Interpolation Savings
This example demonstrates a use case where custom interpolators can be highly beneficial. When creating shaders, it's common to tile and offset UVs multiple times. This behavior can become quite costly, especially when scrolling UVs on a fairly large object. For instance, consider a water shader where the water plane covers most of the terrain. Tiling the UVs in the fragment stage means performing the calculation for every pixel the water plane covers. One way to optimize this is to use custom interpolators to calculate the UVs in the vertex stage first and then pass the data to the fragment stage. Since there are fewer vertices than pixels on the screen, the computational cost will be lower. In this case, unlike the Custom Interpolator NdotL example, we do the samping after so that the rendering results are almost unnoticeable. 

When "InFragStage" is set to "true", the UVs calculated in the fragment stage are used. When "InFragStage" is set to "false", the UVs are scrolled in the vertex stage.
In this case, scrolling UVs in either the vertex or fragment stages won't cause a noticeable difference in the rendering result. However, it's much more cost-friendly to perform the calculations in the vertex stage and pass the data using custom interpolators.


## Detail Mapping
Detail Mapping refers to a set of techniques where additional detail is added to the surface of a model that is not contained in the model’s base set of textures.  These techniques are used when the camera needs to get closer to a model than the resolution of the textures would typically allow, or when the object is so large that the resolution of the base textures is insufficient.

In the three Detail Mapping examples, we’re using a texture packing format for our detail texture called NOS - which is short for Normal, Occlusion, Smoothness.  This indicates that the Normal is stored in the red and green channels of the texture, the ambient occlusion is stored in the blue channel, and the smoothness is stored in the alpha channel. Packing the data together in this way allows us to get maximum use from our single detail texture - and we can add detail to the color, normal, smoothness, and AO with just a single texture sample. To simplify the process, we use the UnpackDetailNOS subgraph to sample the NOS detail texture and unpack the data.
#### Detail Map Color 
For the Color Detail Map example, we simply multiply the Albedo output of the UnpackDetailNOS subgraph with the base color texture. The NOS texture format stores ambient occlusion data in the blue channel of the detail texture - and this occlusion data is what the UnpackDetailNOS subgraph passes to the Albedo output port. So for color detail, we’re just multiplying our base color by the detail AO.

Notice that the effect is quite subtle.  In the past, when detail mapping was a new technique, most surfaces used only color textures - so color detail mapping was the main technique used.  Now that materials use normals, smoothness, occlusion, etc, it works much better to use detail mapping for all of the maps instead of just the color.
#### Detail Map Normal 
For the Detail Map Normal example we combine the Normal output of the UnpackDetailNOS subgraph with the base normal map.  Here we’re using the Normal Blend node to combine the two normals together and we have the Reoriented mode selected for best quality.

Notice that the Detail Map Normal example is significantly more impactful than the Detail Map Color example.  The detail normals are changing the perceived shape of the surface - which has a very strong effect on the lighting, whereas the Color Detail example is only changing the color - which is less effective. This indicates that if you can only apply detail to one of the textures in your material, the normal is the most effective one to add detail to.

If you wanted to make this effect slightly cheaper to render, you could set the Normal Blend node to the Default mode instead (which uses the Whiteout normal blend technique instead).  For another optimization, you could also set the Quality dropdown on the UnpackDetailNOS subgraph to Fast instead of Accurate.  Both of these optimizations together would reduce the number of instructions required to render the effect.  The results would be slightly less accurate, but this might not be noticeable. Try it out in your own shaders and see.  If you can’t tell the difference, use the cheaper techniques for better performance!
#### Detail Map Full
The Detail Map Full example adds detail to the color, normal, ambient occlusion, and smoothness components of the material - so we’re adding additional detail to almost all of the material components.  This is the most effective way to add detail to a surface, but also a little more expensive than the Color or Normal examples.

Take special note of the way that we’re blending each of the outputs of the UnpackDetailNOS subgraph with their counterparts in the main material.  For color, we’re using Multiply - so the detail color data darkens the base color.  For Normal, we’re using the Normal Blend node.  For Ambient Occlusion, we’re using the Minimum node, so the result is whichever result is darker.  We’re using the Minimum node instead of Multiply to prevent the ambient occlusion from getting too dark. And finally, for the smoothness, we’re using Add.  This is because the Smoothness data is in the -0.5 to 0.5 range and adding this range to the base smoothness acts like an overlay with darks darkening and brights brightening.

## Procedural Noise and Shapes
In shaders, the term “procedural” refers to techniques that generate shapes and patterns using a series of math formulas - computed in real-time - instead of sampling texture maps. Procedural noise patterns and shapes have various advantages over texture maps including using no texture memory, covering infinite surface area without repetition or tiling, and being independent of texture resolution.
#### Hex Grid
A Hexagon grid is useful for all types of projects so we decided to include one in the examples. In the example the Grid output port of the HexGrid subgraph is simply connected to the Base Color of the Master Stack. The HexGrid subgraph also has an EdgeDistance output port and a TileID output port.  The Edge Distance output provides a signed distance field value that represents the distance to the nearest hexagon edge. So the pixels right in the center of each hexagon are white and then the closer you get to hexagon edges, the darker the pixels become.  The TileID output port provides a different random value for each tile.

The HexGrid subgraph node also has some useful input ports.  The UV input allows you to control the UV coordinates that are used to generate the pattern.  The Scale input gives you control over the dimensions of the effect on both the X and Y axis.  Finally, the Line Width input controls the thickness of the grid outlines.  Line Width only applied to the Grid output and does not change the output of Edge Distance or TileID.
#### Procedural Brick
The Procedural Brick example shows how a brick pattern can be generated using pure math and no texture samples.  If you’re developing on a platform that is fast at doing math but slow at texture samples, sometimes it can be much more performant to generate patterns like bricks procedurally rather than by sampling textures.  Another advantage is that the variations in the brick patterns don’t repeat - so if you need a pattern to cover a large area without any repetition, procedural generation might be your best option.
#### SDF Shapes
Shader Graph comes with a set of nodes for creating shapes procedurally (Ellipse, Polygon, Rectangle, Rounded Rectangle, Rounded Polygon) but frequently developers find that a signed distance field of the shape is more useful than the shape itself. SDFs can be joined together in interesting ways and give developers more flexibility and control in generating results than just having the shape itself.  This is why we’ve included these SDF shapes in the examples.

## Shader Graph Feature Examples
The Shader Graph tool has several more advanced features - such as port defaults and Custom Interpolators - that can be tricky to set up.  This section contains examples for those features to help users know what is required to set up and use these more advanced features.
#### Subgraph Dropdown
When creating a subgraph node, it’s possible to add a dropdown control to allow users to make a selection. This is useful when there are several different methods of achieving a similar result and you want to allow the user of the subgraph to select which method to use.  This example illustrates how to add a dropdown box to your subgraph.

After creating your subgraph asset, open it in the editor and open the Blackboard panel. Click the plus icon at the top and select Dropdown at the bottom of the list of parameter types. Now give your dropdown a name.  Once the dropdown parameter is named, select it and open the Graph Inspector. Here you can control the number and names of the options in the dropdown list. Use the plus and minus icons at the bottom of the list to add and remove items. And click on individual items in the list to change their names. Once you have the number of items you want in the list, go back to the Blackboard and drag and drop your Blackboard parameter into the graph.  It will appear as a node with input ports to match the list items you created in the Graph Inspector. For each of the input ports, create a graph that generates the results that you want for that option. The dropdown node acts as a switch to switch between the inputs depending on what is selected with the dropdown.

When the subgraph is added to a graph, the user will be able to select an option from the dropdown and the graph will use the branch of the graph that has been selected.  Since the branch is static, only the selected branch will be included in the shader at runtime so no additional shader variants will be generated and no performance penalty will be incurred.
#### Subgraph Port Defaults
You can use the Branch on Input Connection node to set up defaults for the input ports of your subgraphs and even create large graph trees to use if nothing is connected to a specific input port.  The Subgraph Port Defaults example shows how to do that.

After creating your subgraph asset, open it in the editor and open the Blackboard panel. Click the plus icon at the top and select a data type.  In our example, we selected a Vector 2 type because we’re making an input port for UV coordinates. Once you’ve selected a type, give your parameter a name.  We named ours UV. Before adding the parameter to your graph, select it and open the Graph Inspector.  In the Graph Inspector, check the “Use Custom Binding” checkbox and give the parameter a Label.  This is the name that will show up as connected to the port when no external wires are connected. Now, drag and drop your parameter from the Blackboard into the graph. Next, hit the spacebar and add a Branch on Input Connection node.  The node can be found in the Searcher under Utilities->Logic. This node will allow you to set up a default input value or graph branch to use when nothing is connected to the input port. Connect your input parameter’s output port to the Input and Connected input ports of the Branch on Input Connection node.  This will allow the input port to function correctly when a wire is connected to it. Now you can connect a node or node tree to the NotConnected input port.  Whatever is connected here will be what gets used when nothing is connected to this subgraph’s input port. In our example, we’ve connected the UV node and used the Swizzle node so only the X and Y coordinates are used. So with this setup, UV0 will be used if nothing is connected to the input port.

## UV Projection
UV coordinates are used to translate the 3d surface area of models into 2d space that can be used to apply texture maps. This section contains a set of examples for creating, manipulating, and applying UV coordinates to achieve many different types of effects.
#### Flipbook
A flipbook is an effect where a series of frames is played back in sequence.  The frames are arranged in a grid pattern on a texture map. Shader Graph has a built-in node that generates the UVs required to jump from one frame to the next on the texture.

In this example, we show how to use Shader Graph’s built-in Flipbook node to create an animated effect. We also show that you can use a pair of Flipbook nodes to set up an effect that blends smoothly from one frame to the next instead of jumping.

Notice that in the Blackboard, we’ve exposed a Texture parameter for selecting a flipbook texture, Rows and Columns parameters to describe the layout of the flipbook texture, a Speed parameter to control the playback rate of the frames, and a Flip Mode dropdown.

With the Flip Mode dropdown, you can select to Flip from one frame to the next, or to Blend between frames. Notice that if you select the Blend option, the playback appears much more smooth even though the frame rate remains the same. Using this Blend mode is a good way to improve the appearance of the effect and make it feel less choppy, even if the frame rate is low.
#### Flow Mapping
Flow Mapping is a technique that creates the illusion of flowing movement in a texture. It’s achieved by warping the texture coordinates along a specific flow direction over time in two separate phases. When the warping of the first phase becomes too severe, we blend to the second phase which is not yet warped and then warp that while removing the warping from the first phase while it is not displayed. We can blend back and forth between the two phases over and over to create the illusion of motion.

In the example, we’re using the UVFlowMap subgraph which does the main work of the effect. We give it a Flow Map - which is the direction to push the movement.  In our case we’ve used a texture (similar to a normal map) to specify the direction. Then we give it a Strength value - which controls the distance that the UVs get warped. Flow Time can be as simple as just the Time node, but you can also connect a Flow Map Time subgraph which varies the time in different areas to break up the strobing effect.  The UV input controls how the texture is applied.  Notice that we’re using a Tiling And Offset node here to tile the texture 8 times. And finally the Offset value controls the midpoint of the stretching effect. The default value of 0.5 means that each of the phases starts out half stretched in the negative direction, moves to unstretched, and then moves to half stretched in the positive direction.  This will give the best results in most cases.

In our example, we have exposed a Temporal Mode dropdown which illustrates the usefulness of the Flow Map Time subgraph.  When Temporal Mode is set to Time Only, we’re only using Time as the Flow Time input.  There is a noticeable strobing effect where the entire model appears to be pulsing in rhythm.  This is because the blending between phase 1 and phase 2 is happening uniformly across the whole surface.  When we set Temporal Mode to Flow Map Time, we’re using the Flow Map Time subgraph as the Flow Time input.  The Flow Map Time subgraph breaks up the phase blending into smooth gradients across the surface so that it’s non-uniform and removes the strobing effect.
#### Interior Cube Mapping
Interior Cube Mapping is a technique that creates the illusion of building interiors as seen through windows where no interior mesh exists.  The effect can be used to make very simple exterior building meshes appear to have complex interiors and is much cheaper than actually modeling interiors.

In our example, the UVInteriorCubemap subgraph generates the direction vector that we need for sampling our cube map. The cube map creates the illusion of the interiors. And then the rest of the graph creates the exterior building and windows.

The UVInteriorCubemap subgraph has inputs for specifying the number of windows and controlling whether or not to randomize the walls of the cube map.  The randomization rotates the walls of the cube map so that each interior has different walls on the sides and back.  There is also a dropdown for controlling whether the projection is happening in object space or in UV space.
#### Lat Long Projection
The Lat Long Projection example demonstrates the math required to use a texture map in the Latitude Longitude format.  Many high dynamic range environment images are stored in this format so it’s useful to know how to use this type of image.  You can tell an image is in LatLong format because it has a 2 to 1 aspect ratio and usually has the horizon running through the middle.

In our example, we’re using the UVLatLong subgraph. This node generates the UV coordinates needed to sample a texture map in the LatLong format.  By default, the UVLatLong subgraph uses a reflection vector as input - so the result acts like a reflection on the surface of your model. But if you wanted the result to be stuck to the surface instead, you could use the Normal Vector.

If you select the Sample Texture 2D node and open the Graph Inspector, notice that the Mip Sampling Mode is set to Gradient.  With that setting, the Sample Texture 2D node has DDX and DDY input ports - which we have connected to the DDX and DDY nodes.  We’re doing this because the texture coordinates generated for the LatLong projection have a hard seam where the left and right sides of the projection wrap around and come together.  If we were to set the Mip Sampling Mode to Standard instead, we would end up with a hard seam where the texture sampler failed because there is a large discontinuity in the mip values of the texture coordinates. The Gradient Mip Sampling Mode allows us to manually calculate our own mip level with the DDX and DDY nodes instead of allowing the sampler to do it.
#### Mat Cap (Sphere Mapping) 
The Mat Cap Material example demonstrates the math required to project a sphere map onto a surface. This effect is often called a Mat Cap - or material capture, because you can represent the properties of a material - like reflections or subsurface scattering - in the way the texture is created.  Some 3d sculpting software uses MatCap projection to render objects.  You can tell that a texture is a sphere map (or MatCap) because it looks a bit like a picture of a chrome ball. Sphere maps are the cheapest form of reflection - both in texture memory and in the low cost of math. But they’re not accurate because they always face the camera.

In our example, we’re using the UVSphereMap subgraph to generate the texture coordinates to sample the sphere map. The subgraph has an input for the surface normal - and you can use the dropdown to select the space that the normal is in.  By default, the Vertex Normal is used, but you could also connect a normal map to it if you wanted to give the surface more detail.
#### Parallax Mapping
There are many techniques that attempt to add more detail to the shape of a surface than is actually represented in the geometry of the surface.  The Parallax Mapping example demonstrates three of these examples, and you can select which example to display with the Bump Type dropdown box in the material.
##### Normal Only
This technique is the cheapest and most common. It uses a normal map to change the apparent shape of the surface - where each pixel in the map represents the direction that the surface is facing at that point. Because there is no offsetting of the surface happening, this technique also looks fairly flat compared to the other two.

##### Parallax
Parallax Mapping samples a height map and then uses the value to offset the UV coordinates based on their height relative to the view direction. This causes parallax motion to occur on the surface and makes the surface feel like it has actual depth.  However, when seen at steep angles, the effect often has artifacts.  Where there are steep changes in the height map, there are visible stretching artifacts.
##### Parallax Occlusion
Parallax Occlusion Mapping samples a height map multiple times (based on the number of Steps) in a path along the view vector and reconstructs the scene depth of the surface. It uses this depth information to derive UV coordinates for sampling the textures. This process is expensive - especially with a high number of Steps, but can be made cheaper by creating a mask to reduce the number of Steps based on the camera distance and angle of the surface. Our example illustrates this technique.
#### Triplanar Projection
Triplanar projection projects a texture onto the surface of a model from the front, side, and top.  It’s useful when you want to apply a texture but the model doesn’t have good UV coordinates, or when the UVs are laid out for something else.  It’s also useful when you want to project the same texture or material on many objects in close proximity and have the projection be continuous across them.

There are several methods for projecting a texture onto a surface.  Our example shows four of them and you can select the method you want to see using the Projection Type dropdown in the material.  They’re in order from most expensive to least.

##### Triplanar Texture projection
The Triplanar Textures technique uses the built-in Triplanar node in Shader Graph.  This node samples each of your textures three times - for the top, front, and side projections and then blends between the three samples.  This technique is the nicest looking since it blends between the samples, but it’s also the most expensive.

##### Biplanar Texture projection
This is a clever optimization to triplanar projection that uses two texture samples instead of three. The shader figures out which two faces are most important to the projection and only samples those two instead of all three. On most platforms, it will be cheaper than Triplanar Textures, but more expensive than Triplanar UVs. Depending on the textures you’re sampling, you may notice a small singularity artifact at the corner where the three faces come together.

##### Triplanar UV projection
The Triplanar UVs technique uses the UVTriplanar subgraph to project the UV coordinates from the top front and side and then use those to sample the textures only one time instead of three. Because it’s only sampling each texture one time, this technique is cheaper. The UV coordinates can’t be blended like the textures can - so this technique has hard seams where projections come together instead of blending like the Triplanar Textures technique.  However, these seams aren’t very noticeable on some materials, so this may be an acceptable alternative if you need to do triplanar projection more cheaply.

Notice that the normal map needs to be plugged into the UVTriplanarNormalTransform node when using this technique in order to get the normals transformed correctly.

##### UV
This option just applies the textures using standard UV coordinates.  It’s here so that you can easily compare it with the other two techniques.

## Vertex Animation
Generally, we think of shaders as changing the color and appearance of pixels.  But shaders can also be applied to vertices - to change the position of the points of a mesh. The model’s vertices can be manipulated by a shader to create all sorts of animated effects - as shown in this section.
#### Animated Flag
This example shows a simple method for making a flag that ripples in the wind. The effect centers around the Sine node - which is what creates the rippling motion. We take the X position of the vertices and multiply them by a value that controls the length of the waves. We multiply that by Time and then pass that into the Sine node.  Finally, we multiply the result of the Sine wave with a mask that goes from 0 at the point where the flag attaches to the pole, 1 at the tip of the flat where the effect should be strongest.  The result is a simple rippling flag.

You could add additional detail to this effect if you combined several different sine waves that move at different speeds and wavelengths to vary and randomize the results. But something as simple as this example may be all that is needed if your flag is seen at a distance.

#### Bend Deformer - Grass
This example shows the math required to bend a rectangle-shaped strip in an arc shape without changing its length. This can be used for animating blades of grass. The BendDeformer subgraph adjusts both the position and the normal of the vertices - so we get proper lighting on the updated shape. 
#### Billboard
The billboard example illustrates the math that we use to make a flat plane face the camera.  Notice that the Billboard subgraph has a dropdown that allows us to select the initial direction that our plane is facing. Selecting the correct option here will ensure that our plane turns toward the camera correctly and not some other direction.
#### Gerstner Wave
In this example, we use several instances of the GerstnerWave subgraph to animate waves in our mesh.  The GerstnerWave subgraph does the math required to realistically simulate the movement of a single wave. Notice that each of the three instances has a different direction, wave length, and wave height.  Combining these three different wave sizes together creates a really nice-looking wave simulation.  The Offset values are added together and then added to the Position.  The normals are combined using the Normal Blend node and then used directly as the Normal.

## Particles
This example shows that it’s possible to create a simple particle system using nothing but Shader Graph! This method of creating particles is cheap because it’s done 100% on the GPU and almost all of the shader work happens in the vertex shader.  This shader is not intended as a replacement for any of the other particle systems in Unity, but simply as an illustration of what’s possible to do with just Shader Graph alone. It could potentially be cheaper to make simple particle effects using this shader than with other methods.  It’s definitely not as powerful or as full-featured as something made with VFX Graph, for example.

We start by creating a stack of planes where each plane in the stack has a slightly different vertex color. We use this value as an ID to differentiate each plane in the stack. This sample set comes with 3 stacks of planes that can be used.  One with 25 planes, one with 50 planes, and one with 100 planes.  

> Note that most particle systems dynamically generate particles based on the number that the system needs, but we’re using static geometry, so we’re locked in to using the number of planes in the geometry we choose. If the system we create with the material parameters requires more particles, the only way to fix it is to swap out the mesh that we’re using - so this is one major downside to this method.

We use the Billboard subgraph to make all of the planes face the camera and we use the Flipbook node to add an animated effect to the particles. We also add gravity and wind to control the movement of the particles. In the pixel shader, we expose control over the opacity and even fade out particle edges where they intersect with other scene geometry.

Here’s a description of the exposed material parameters that control the appearance and behavior of the particles:

Emitter Dimensions - controls the size of the particle emitter in X,Y, and Z. Particles will be born in random locations within the volume specified by these dimensions.
#### Color
This is a color value that gets multiplied by the FlipbookTexture color. The StartColor blends to the EndColor throughout the lifetime of the particle. The alpha value of the color gets multiplied by the alpha value of the FlipbookTexture to contribute to the opacity of the particles.
**Start Color** - the color multiplier for the particle at the beginning of its life
**EndColor** - the color multiplier for the particle at the end of its life

#### Opacity
These controls change the opacity/transparency behavior of the particles.
**Opacity** - the overall opacity multiplier. Values above one are acceptable and can make subtle particles more visible.
**FadeInPower** - controls the falloff curve of the particle fade-in.
**FadeOutPower** - controls the falloff curve of the particle fade-out.
**SoftEdges** - enables the soft edges feature which fades out the particles where they intersect with scene geometry.
**AlphaClipThreshold** - controls the opacity cut-off below which pixels are discarded and not drawn. The higher this value is, the more pixels can be discarded to reduce particle overdraw.
#### Scale
Controls the size of the particles. Particles transition from the ParticleStartSize to the ParticleEndSize over their lifetime.
**ParticleStartSize** - the size of the particle (in meters) when it is born.
**ParticleEndSize** - the size of the particle (in meters) when it dies.
#### Movement
These controls affect the movement of the particles.
**ConstantFlow** - the smoothness of the flow of the particles. A value of 1 distributes particle flow evenly over time. A value of 0 spawns all of the particles and once right at the beginning of the phase.  Values in between make particle birthrate/flow more random and hitchy.
**ParticleSpeed** - controls the overall speed of the particles
**ParticleDirection** - the main direction of particle movement
**ParticleSpread** - the width of the particle emission cone in degrees. A value of 0 will emit particles in single direction and a value of 360 will emit particles in all directions (a sphere)
**ParticleVelocityStart** - controls how fast the particles are moving when they’re first born.
**ParticleVelocityEnd** - controls how fast the particles are moving when they die.
#### Rotation
Controls the rotation behavior of the particles.
**Rotation** - the static amount of rotation to apply to each particle in degrees.
**RotationRandomOffset** - when checked, applies a random rotation amount to each particle
**RotationSpeed** - the speed of rotation of each particle
**RandomizeRotationDirection** - when true, each particle randomly either goes clockwise or counterclockwise.
#### Flipbook
Controls the behavior of the animated texture that is applied to the particles.
**FlipbookTexture** - the flipbook texture to apply to the particles
**FlipbookDimensions** - the number of rows and columns in the selected flipbook texture
**FlipbookSpeed** - the playback frame rate of the flipbook.
**MatchParticlePhase** - when true, the first frame of the flipbook will play when the particle is born and the last frame will play just before the particle dies - so the flipbook playback length will match the particle’s lifetime.
#### Forces
Control the external forces that affect the particle movement.
**Gravity** - the pull of gravity on the particles.  This is typically 0,-9.8, 0 - but some types of material, such as smoke or mist may be warm or lighter than air, which would cause them to move upward instead of getting pulled down by gravity.
**Wind** - the direction and strength of the wind.
#### Debug
These controls allow you to debug specific parts of the particle system.
**DebugTime** - When true, allows you to scrub time backwards and forward manually with the ManualTime slider.
**ManualTime** - when DebugTime is true, you can use this slider to scrub time backwards and forward to see how the particles behave at different points during their lifetime.

## Conditions
This section illustrates two ways to branch your shader.

#### Branch On Render Pipeline
Shader Graph allows you to create shaders that can be used in multiple render pipelines- Built-In, URP, and HDRP.  This can be done by opening the shader in Shader Graph and adding the targets for all of the pipelines you want the shader to support in the Active Targets section under Graph Settings in the Graph Inspector window.

When supporting multiple render pipelines, it’s occasionally necessary to do different things in the graph depending on which pipeline is being used.  In order to do that, you need to branch the shader based on the active render pipeline.  There isn’t an official node in Shader Graph for performing that branching operation, but it is possible to create a subgraph that contains a Custom Function node that does the branch.

In this example, we use that Branch On RP to create a different outcome depending which render pipeline is active.  In our simple example, we just make the cube a different color - green for URP, blue for HDRP, and yellow for the Built-In render pipeline - but you can do much more complex operations that are specific to each render pipeline using this same technique.

#### Branch On Material Quality

With Shader Graph, you can create one shader that has multiple different ways of achieving the same effect depending on how much GPU processing power you want to dedicate to it.  This example illustrates that.  We show three different methods of combining two normal maps together.  The first method (at the top of the graph) is using the Normal Blend node set to Reoriented mode.  This is the most accurate method that provides the best looking results, but it also requires the most compute power. The second method (in the middle of the graph) is almost as nice and a little bit cheaper.  The third method (at the bottom of the graph) is the cheapest and produces the lowest quality result.

On the right side of the graph, you can see that the three different methods are connected to the Material Quality node. You can add a Material Quality node by opening the Blackboard and selecting Keyword->Material Quality from the add menu.  Then drag the Material Quality parameter from the Blackboard into your graph.   This node will select the top, middle, or bottom part of the graph depending on the Quality level that is selected.

In HDRP, the Quality setting is defined by the Default Material Quality Level setting found in the Material section of the HD Render Pipeline Asset. So for each Quality level, you define a pipeline asset, and that asset has the setting that controls which quality level the shader uses.

In a URP project, you can use the SetGlobalShaderKeywords command in the script that gets run when the user selects options in the application’s UI.  For example, the following command will set Material Quality to High:

MaterialQualityUtilities.SetGlobalShaderKeywords( MaterialQuality.High );

Using the Material Quality node in Shader Graph enables you to provide the user with the ability to customize their experience in the application.  They can choose to see higher quality visuals at a lower frame rate, or lower-quality visuals at a higher frame rate. And you control what these options do in the shader itself.

# Forest Stream Construction Tutorial
This tutorial shows you, step by step, how to use the assets included in this sample to construct a forest stream environment.

1. [Sculpt Terrain](#step-1)
2. [Paint Terrain Materials](#step-2)
3. [Add Water Planes](#step-3)
4. [Add Waterfall Meshes](#step-4)
5. [Add Rocks](#step-5)
6. [Add Water Decals](#step-6)
7. [Add Reflection Probes](#step-7)
8. [Add Terrain Detail Meshes](#step-8)
[Additional Ideas](#additional-ideas)


## <a name="step-1">Step 1 - Sculpt Terrain</a>
1. Start by blocking out the main shapes of the terrain. Use the **Set Height** brush to create a sloping terrain by creating a series of terraces and then use the **Smooth** brush to smooth out the hard edges between the terraces.

2. Cut in the stream channel with the **Set Height** brush in several different tiers heading down the slope. After you cut in the stream, smooth out the hard edges with the **Smooth** brush.

3. Add polish to finalize the terrain shape. Use the **Raise/Lower Height** brush and the **Smooth** brush to add touch-ups and variety.  In this process, start out with large brushes and end with the small ones.

When this step is done, you can revisit the terrain shape occasionally to add additional touch ups, especially after adding in the water meshes in steps 3 and 4, to ensure that the water meshes and terrain shape work together.


## <a name="step-2">Step 2 - Paint Terrain Materials</a>
Next, it’s time to add materials to our terrain.  We have four material layers - cobblestone rocks for our stream bed, dry dirt, rocky moss, and mossy grass. To apply the materials, we begin by establishing guidelines.  The stones material goes in the stream bed.  The dirt material goes along the banks of the stream. As a transition between the first and the grass, we use the rocky moss material. And finally, we use the grass material for the background.

1. First block in the materials according to the guidelines with large, hard-edged brushes. 
2. Then we go back and blend the materials together using smaller brushes. Paint one material over the other using brushes with a low opacity value to blend the two materials together.

Even though our terrain materials exhibit tiling artifacts by themselves, we’re able to hide the tiling by giving each material a different tiling frequency. When the materials are blended, they break up each others tiling artifacts.  We also cover the terrain with detail meshes (step 7) which further hides the tiling.

## <a name="step-3">Step 3 - Add Water Planes</a>
The stream itself is constructed from simple planes that are added to the scene.
1. Right-click in the Hierarchy panel and select **3D Object**>**Plane**. 
2. Then apply the WaterStream material.  
3. Place the planes in the stream channel that’s cut into the terrain.
4. Scale the planes along the Z axis to stretch them along the length of the stream. Water flows in the local -Z direction of the planes. Planes are scaled as long as they need to be in order to reach from one stream height drop to the next.

Notice that the edges of the stream mesh are transparent at the start and at the end.  This is to allow the stream meshes to blend together correctly with the waterfall meshes that link the stream planes together.

## <a name="step-4">Step 4 - Add Waterfall Meshes</a>
The waterfall meshes are designed to connect one level of stream plane to the next lower level. 
1. Place the waterfall meshes at the end of a stream plane. They slope down to connect to the next stream plane. 
2. Rotate the waterfall meshes around the Y axis to align the waterfall mesh between the two stream planes.
3. Scale the waterfall mesh on the Y axis so that the bottom portion of the waterfall mesh aligns with the lower stream plane. The pivot point of the waterfall is lined up vertically with the top portion of the waterfall, so you can place the waterfall mesh at the exact same height as the top stream plane, and then scale to meet the lower stream plane.

Notice that the Sorting Priority parameter in the Advanced Options of the material has been set to -1.  This makes the waterfall meshes draw behind the stream meshes so there isn’t a draw order conflict.

## <a name="step-5">Step 5 - Add Rocks</a>
Streams are often filled with rocks that have been pushed by the current. To save memory and reduce draw calls, we’re just using two different rock meshes that both use the same texture set.
1. Place rocks at random intervals along the length of the stream.
2. Rotate and scale the rocks to give a variety of appearances. 

Notice that we’ve created visual variety by creating two different sizes of rocks - large boulders, and smaller rocks. Overall, the rocks break up the shape of the stream and change the pattern of the foam on the water surface.

## <a name="step-6">Step 6 - Add Water Decals</a>
We use the Water Wetness and Water Caustics decal to more tightly integrate the stream water with the terrain and rocks. The Wetness decal makes the terrain and other meshes around the stream look like they’re wet, and the Caustics decal imitates the appearance of lighting getting refracted by the surface of the water and getting focused in animated patterns on the bottom of the stream.

1. Create and scale the Wetness decals so that the top of the decal extends around half a meter above the surface of the water. The top of the Caustics decal should be just under the water.
2. Create and scale the caustics decals so that the caustic patterns are only projected under the water planes.

For both decals, the decal volumes should be kept as small as possible in all three dimensions - just large enough to cover their intended use and no larger. You can also save some performance by lowering the Draw Distance parameter on each decal so they are not drawn at a distance.

## <a name="step-7">Step 7 - Add Reflection Probes</a>
Reflections are a critical component of realistic-looking water. 
1. To improve the appearance of the water reflections, create a Reflection Probe for each of the stream segments and place it at about head height and in the middle of the stream. If there are objects like rocks and trees nearby, they will be captured in the Reflection Probes and then reflected more accurately in the water.

Especially notice how water to the right of this point correctly reflects the high bank behind the signs while water to the left only reflects the sky. The Reflection Probes contribute this additional realism.

## <a name="step-8">Step 8 - Add Terrain Detail Meshes</a>
Our last step is to add detail meshes to the terrain. 
1. Add pebble meshes everywhere, including under the water. 
2. Add broad-leaf nettle plants around the edges of the water in the dirt areas. 
3. Add ferns (3 variations) just above the nettle in the transition between dirt and grass.
4. Add clover in between the ferns and the grass. 
5. For the grass, add the three different meshes. Each of them fade out at a different distance from the camera to soften the fade-out so that it doesn’t happen all at once. The most dense grass is only visible at 10 meters from the camera to improve performance. Paint the three different grass layers somewhat randomly with all three layers being applied where the terrain grass material is most dense and the most sparse grass being painted around the edges. Each grass mesh also has slightly different wind direction and intensity values in the material to give variety to the grass appearance. Only one of the three grass meshes has shadows turned on - which gives the impression of grass shadows without paying the full performance cost.

To save on performance, our terrain is set to fade out the detail meshes at 30 meters. This allows us to achieve a nice density of meshes up close and then get rid of them further away where they’re not as visible.  We hide the transition by dither fading the meshes in the shader before the 30 meter point so there’s no popping.

## <a name="additional-ideas">Additional Ideas</a>
We have a pretty nice looking environment here, but there’s a lot more that could be done. You could complete this environment by adding your own trees, stumps and fallen logs.

# Examples
These example shaders are built using the subgraph nodes. They show how the subgraph nodes work and how you can  combine them to create backgrounds, buttons, and meters.

## Backgrounds
The background examples are shaders that you can assign to Canvas Image objects that serve as backgrounds for other UI elements.

- PosterizeUV

### RoundedRectangleBubble
This example shows how to create a rounded frame as a background, including an outline and a drop shadow, for other UI elements. To maintain the correct aspect ratio of the rounded corners in this shader, connect the exposed WidthHeight parameter of this shader to the UI Image element’s Width and Height parameters.  You can do this with the ImageSize script. Refer to [How to make shapes that adapt to the aspect ratio of the UI element](Shader-Graph-Sample-UGUI-Shaders-How-tos-aspect-ratio.md) for details on how to accomplish this.

Library Subgraph Nodes used in this sample:

## Buttons
![User interface component with three distinct buttons labeled Button and a circular person icon. From left to right: a blue capsule-shaped button, a circular person icon, a dark blue rhombus button, and a green rounded rectangle button. ](images/UITools-buttons.png) 
These examples show how to create buttons of various visual styles. Each button has exposed parameters that control the button’s visual states - selected, pressed, and active. In the example scene, you can take a look at how these material parameters are connected to the button’s state events to drive the appearance of the button.

Many shape elements of the buttons use the AntiAliasing node which converts SDFs and gradients to perfectly anti-aliased shapes, regardless of scale or camera position. For more details on how to accomplish this, refer to [How to create a resolution-independent shape](Shader-Graph-Sample-UGUI-Shaders-How-tos-Res-indepenent.md).

### AquaButton
This example shows how to create an aqua-style button and includes a specular highlight, gradient shading, a fresnel outline, and a colored drop shadow. It adjusts to the aspect ratio of the button object it’s assigned to using the WidthHeight parameter. In the sample scene, notice that this material parameter is connected to the UI object’s width and height values using the ImageSize script.

Library Subgraph Nodes used in this sample:
- Move
- AspectRatio
- AnimatedSheen
- Pill

### SciFiButton
This example uses multiple circular elements and illustrates how multiple elements can be combined with subtract, maximum, lerp, and multiply.

Library Subgraph Nodes used in this sample:
- Circle
- CircleSegments
- AntiAliasing
- Scale
- PlayerIcon

### SciFiButton2
This button example is similar to the Tech Grid background.  It uses the SquareTiles node to create a grid and the AnimatedClouds node to create a smooth noise background. It also illustrates the use of the Tilt node to turn the rectangle shape into a parallelogram.

Library Subgraph Nodes used in this sample:
- AspectRatio
- LinearTime
- CircleSegments
- Rectangle
- AntiAliasing

- AntiAliasing

## Indicators
![From left to right: A rounded, 3D capsule split into orange and black halves, a circular icon featuring a person symbol, framed by a blue arc, a transparent sphere partially filled with glowing red liquid, a gradient progress bar fading from pink to purple and blue.](images/UITools-meters2.png)

These UI elements indicate things to the player visually such as health level, ammo count, shield power, etc. All of them have an exposed material parameter called “Health” that drives the level of the meter. Using a script, you can connect this parameter to any value in your project to indicate its level to the player.

### AquaMeter
The style of this meter matches the AquaButton example - but instead of exposing button states, it has a controllable fill meter.

Library Subgraph Nodes used in this sample:
- AspectRatio
- Pill
- AntiAliasing
- HistogramScan

### DialMeter
This example uses polar coordinates to create a circular-shaped meter. It also uses drop-shadows on both the inner circle and the outer shape. The player icon at the center could be replaced with a texture sample or another SDF shape.

Library Subgraph Nodes used in this sample:
- AspectRatio
- Pill
- AntiAliasing
- HistogramScan

### FantasyMeter
This example could be used as a health or mana indicator for a fantasy game. It uses the SphereGradient node to generate fake lighting and reflections based on a procedurally-generated sphere shape. The sphere defaults to being filled with red liquid, but you can easily change the color to anything you like by using the exposed Color parameter.

Library Subgraph Nodes used in this sample:
- LinearGradient
- PosterizeGradient
- Hash11
- LinearTime
- GridTiles
- Move
- Circle
- HistogramScan
- Waves
- AntiAliasing
- Gradients
- SphereGradient

### SciFiMeter
This meter could be used to indicate ammo or shield level in a sci-fi-themed game. The cool thing about this one is that it starts to shake when the indicator gets low - to emphasize the urgency of low ammo or shields.

Library Subgraph Nodes used in this sample:
- Shake
- AspectRatio
- Tilt
- Rectangle
- AntiAliasing
- WindowBlinds
- PosterizeGradient
- HistogramScan

## Progress Bars
![From left to right: A circular segmented ring with a gradient transitioning from orange and brown to dark purple; a gradient bar smoothly blending from dark purple through pink, orange, yellow, to light gray; a spinner with circular segments fading from light to dark to simulate motion; and another spinner featuring green dots forming an incomplete curved circle, with larger dots clustered at the bottom-right and smaller ones tapering toward the top-left.](images/UITools-meters.png) 

### FancyLoading
This is a circle that’s made of circles. Each circle starts large and then gets smaller over time and the effect is offset so it happens in a wave pattern. The larger circle pattern also appears to move and change perspective over time as if it were tilting around in a 3D space. These effects are all achieved by chaining together various nodes from the Subgraph Library.

Library Subgraph Nodes used in this sample:
- SineTime
- Perspective
- Scale
- Move
- LinearTime
- GridTiles
- Circle

# How to make shapes that adapt to the aspect ratio of the UI element
Buttons and other UI elements come in all shapes and sizes. Frequently, the same style of button or background element needs to work with many different shapes or adapt to a changing width and height. Many of the UI elements in this sample are designed to adapt to changing dimensions.  Follow these steps to create a UI element that can do that.

1. Create a new Shader Graph asset. 
1. In the Graph Inspector, set the Shader Graph’s Material setting to **Canvas**.
1. Add an SDF Pill node to the new Shader Graph file. ( You can find this node in the **Add Node** menu under **UI/SDFs**.) 
1. Connect the Pill node’s **Fill** output port to the **Base Color** input port of the **Master Stack**. Now you’ve created a shader for a UI element that’s meant to be square.  If you assign this shader to a non-square UI element, it will stretch and not look like a proper pill shape.
Notice that the Pill node’s last input port is called **WidthHeight**. This is an input for the width and height data of the UI element that the shader will be assigned to. By default, the Pill node assumes the UI element will be square, but if you plan to use a different aspect ratio, you can enter other values. Rather than entering the values manually, it’s best to connect them to the actual UI element values.  That’s what we’ll do next.
1. Open the **Blackboard** and add a new Vector2 parameter.  
1. Name the parameter **WidthHeight**.  
1. Drag the parameter into the graph and connect it to the **WidthHeight** input port on the Pill node.  You’ve now exposed the **WidthHeight** parameter so it can be connected outside the shaders.
1. In your scene, create a new **Canvas** element (if there isn’t one already) in the **Hierarchy** panel. (Right click in the **Hierarchy** panel and select **UI** > **Canvas**). 
1. Then add an Image element to the Canvas. (Right click on the **Canvas** element and select **UI** > **Image**) Select the Image element.
1. Select the material associated with your shader in the Project panel and drag and drop it into the Material slot in the Inspector for the Image UI element. Now your shader’s material is assigned to the UI element.
1. Click the **Add Component** button at the bottom of the Inspector. 
1. Select and assign the **Image Size** script to the Image element.  This script connects the Image element’s Width and Height parameters to the WidthHeight parameter of your shader, so when the Width or Height values change, the shader adapts.

Now you have a shader that will adapt to the aspect ratio of the UI element it’s assigned to. You can adjust the Width and Height parameters of the Image element and the Pill shape will maintain its rounded shape. This same feature is also available on many of the other nodes in the node library. You can control any subgraph node with a WidthHeight input port in this same way.

# How to create a functioning button
Buttons have multiple states depending on the user’s interaction with them. The button may change its appearance when the user’s mouse is hovering over the button. And when it’s pressed, the button may also change to indicate the press.  That means that the shader needs to create the various visual styles and expose parameters to trigger them.  You’ll then need to connect those exposed parameters to the button’s events. Follow these steps to learn how to do that.

1. Create a new Shader Graph asset. 
1. In the Graph Inspector, make sure that the Shader Graph’s Material setting is set to **Canvas**.
1. Open the shader’s Blackboard and add two boolean parameters.  
1. Name the parameters **Selected** and **Pressed**.
1. Drag these parameters into your graph and use them to create a shader that changes depending on if the values are true or false.  The SimpleButton Shader Graph asset is a good example of this.  Find it here: `Assets/Samples/Shader Graph/<your version>/UGUI Shaders/Examples/Buttons/SimpleButton`
1. In your scene, create a new Canvas element (if there isn’t one already) in the **Hierarchy** panel. (Right click in the Hierarchy panel and select **UI** > **Canvas**). 
1. Add a Button element to the Canvas. (Right click on the Canvas element and select **UI** > **Button - TextMeshPro**) Then select the Button element.
1. Select the material associated with your shader in the Project panel and drag and drop it into the Material slot in the Inspector for the Image UI element. Now your shader’s material is assigned to the UI element. 
1. Set the button’s **Source Image** and **Transition** to None. The shader provides these.
- Now click the **Add Component** button at the bottom of the Inspector and add the script called **UI Material**.  This script exposes the Selected and Pressed parameters so they can be used by other scripts.
1. Click **Add Component** again and add the script called **ButtonMaterial**.  This script connects the material’s exposed button parameters to the button’s events.

Now you have a button that correctly passes information to its material when the mouse pointer hovers over the button, presses down on the button, stops pressing the button, and moves off of the button.  You can set up the shader to respond to these events visually in whatever way makes sense for the style.  For example, when the button is pressed, you might move the button down slightly, invert its color, or get darker. When the mouse is hovering over the button, you might make an outline appear around it, or turn on an animated sheen effect.

# How to create a resolution-independent shape
When creating a UI element, it’s very useful to be able to make it resolution-independent - meaning that it looks sharp and crisp regardless of if it’s rendered at very high resolution or very low resolution. UI elements that are based on textures are resolution dependent. The texture itself has a specific resolution - so if the UI element is rendered at a higher resolution than the texture, the result will be blurry, and if the texture is a higher resolution than the UI element is rendered, you’ll get filtering artifacts and waste texture memory.

With the nodes in the library included with this sample set, you can generate shapes procedurally instead of with textures. You can render these shapes at any resolution and they will always look perfectly sharp and smoothly anti-aliased.  Here’s how to do it:

1. Add one of the SDF shape nodes (Circle, Hexagon, Pill, Rectangle, Star, or Triangle) to your graph. You can find them in the Add Node menu under UI/SDFs. These nodes generate shapes using signed distance fields. If you grab the output from the Fill output port, you’ll get a shape, but you can also get the raw SDF output from the SDF output port. Each pixel in the SDF is a value that represents the distance to the nearest edge of the shape. Pixels that are inside the shape have a negative value to indicate that.
1. Add an AntiAliasing node to your graph. You can find it in the Add Node menu under UI/Helpers.  The AntiAliasing node is designed to “resolve” an SDF into an anti-aliased shape in a resolution-independent way.
1. Connect the SDF output port of your SDF shape node to the Gradient input port of the AntiAliasing node. 
1. Set the Cutoff port to a default value of zero. The AntiAliasing node will convert the shape’s SDF into a solid shape using a method that correctly adapts to the number of pixels on the screen.
1. To make your shape white and the background black, connect the **Out** port of the AntiAliasing node to a One Minus node to invert the result.

You now have a resolution-independent shape. You can fill the whole screen with this shape and render it at 8k, or scale it down to a tiny portion of the screen and render it on a low-end smartphone and it will have a sharp, anti-aliased edge in all cases.

# 3DS Physical Material Inspector reference

The 3DS Physical Material shader replicates the 3DS Physical Material shader available in Autodesk® 3DsMax for the High Definition Render Pipeline (HDRP). When Unity imports an FBX that includes a material using Autodesk's 3DS Physical Material shader, it applies HDRP's 3DS Physical Material shader to the material. The material properties and texture inputs are identical between the Unity and Autodesk versions of this shader. The materials themselves also look and respond to light similarly.

**Note**: There are slight differences between what you see in Autodesk® 3DsMax and what you see in HDRP. HDRP doesn't support some material features.

**Note**: The HDRP implementation of the 3DS Physical Material shader uses a Shader Graph.

## Create a 3DS Physical Material

When Unity imports an FBX with a compatible 3DS Physical Material shader, it automatically creates a 3DS Physical Material. If you want to manually create a 3DS Physical Material:

1. Create a new material (menu: **Assets** > **Create** > **Material**).
2. In the Inspector for the Material, click the Shader drop-down then click **HDRP** > **3DSMaxPhysicalMaterial** > **PhysicalMaterial3DSMax**.

# Universal Render Pipeline scripting API

This is the documentation for the scripting APIs of the Universal Render Pipeline (URP) package.

**Note**:  URP is built on the Scriptable Render Pipeline (SRP) Core package, and uses some class types that you can only find in the [SRP Core scripting API](https://docs.unity3d.com/Packages/com.unity.render-pipelines.core@17.3/api/index.html).

# Arnold Standard Surface Material Inspector reference

The Arnold Standard Surface shader replicates the Arnold Standard Surface shader available in Autodesk® 3DsMax and Autodesk® Maya for the High Definition Render Pipeline (HDRP). When Unity imports an FBX that includes a material using Autodesk's Arnold Standard Surface shader, it applies HDRP's Arnold Standard Surface shader to the material. The material properties and texture inputs are identical between the Unity and Autodesk versions of this shader. The materials themselves also look and respond to light similarly.

**Note**: There are slight differences between what you see in Autodesk® Maya or Autodesk® 3DsMax and what you see in HDRP and HDRP doesn't support some material features.

![Arnold Standard materials imported from FBX seen in Unity.](Images/arnold-standard-surface-example-unity.png)

The same materials imported from FBX seen in Unity.

Note that the HDRP implementation of this shader uses a Shader Graph.

## Creating an Arnold Standard Surface material

When Unity imports an FBX with a compatible Arnold shader, it automatically creates an Arnold material. If you want to manually create an Arnold Standard Surface material:

1. Create a new material (menu: **Assets** > **Create** > **Material**).
2. In the Inspector for the Material, click the Shader drop-down then click **HDRP** > **ArnoldStandardSurface** > **ArnoldStandardSurface**.

# Autodesk Interactive Masked Material Inspector reference

The Autodesk Interactive masked shader replicates the Interactive PBS with the masked preset available in Autodesk® 3DsMax and Autodesk® Maya for the High Definition Render Pipeline (HDRP). It acts like a [cutout shader](https://docs.unity3d.com/Manual/shader-TransparentCutoutFamily.html). When Unity imports an FBX exported from one of these softwares, if the FBX includes materials with Interactive PBS shaders, Unity imports these materials as Autodesk Interactive materials. The material properties and textures inputs are identical between these two materials. The materials themselves also look and respond to light similarly.

**Note**: There are slight differences between what you see in Autodesk® Maya or Autodesk® 3DsMax and what you see in Unity.

Autodesk® Maya or Autodesk® 3DsMax also include two variants of this shader, which are also available in HDRP:

- [Autodesk Interactive](autodesk-interactive-material-inspector-reference.md)
- [Autodesk Interactive Transparent](autodesk-interactive-transparent-material-inspector-reference.md)

**Note**: This shader is implemented as a [Shader Graph](https://docs.unity3d.com/Packages/com.unity.shadergraph@latest/index.html).

## Creating an Autodesk Interactive masked material

When Unity imports an FBX with a compatible Autodesk shader, it automatically creates an Autodesk Interactive material. If you want to manually create an Autodesk Interactive material:

1. Create a new material (menu: **Assets** > **Create** > **Material**).
2. In the Inspector for the Material, click the **Shader** drop-down then click **HDRP** > **Autodesk Interactive** > **AutodeskInteractiveMasked**.

# Introduction to keywords in Shader Graph

Keywords enable you to create shader variants that address multiple contexts, for example:

* Features that you can turn on or off for each material instance.
* Features that behave differently on certain platforms.
* Shaders that scale in complexity based on conditions you set.

For more information about keywords and how they affect the final shader, refer to [Changing how shaders work using keywords](https://docs.unity3d.com/Manual/SL-MultipleProgramVariants.html).

## Conditions and keyword types

There are two types of keywords you can use depending on the type of conditions you need to set up:

* Boolean keywords, either on or off, to enable switching between two shader branches.
* Enum keywords, with two or more states, to enable switching between two or more shader branches.

## Keyword impact optimization

Each keyword you add in your shader graph implies the addition of one or more branches in the graph. When you add multiple keywords, the number of branch combinations for a single shader graph increases extremely fast, which might result in significant performance impact at build time or at runtime.

To minimize or balance performance impacts according to your project needs and your production context, you can define how Unity addresses the underlying behavior of each keyword at build time and at runtime. This mostly involves the use of either [dynamic branching](#dynamic-branching) or [shader variants](#shader-variants).

For example, you might consider setting your keywords for dynamic branching during development, to speed up build and iteration time, and then set them to shader variants toward the end of the project to improve runtime performance.

For more information about keyword declarations and behaviors, refer to [How Unity compiles branching shaders](https://docs.unity3d.com/Manual/shader-conditionals-choose-a-type.html).

### Keyword Definition

Each keyword has its own [**Definition** parameter](Keywords-reference.md#common-parameters) which lets you define the keyword behavior at build time and at runtime.

<a name="dynamic-branching"></a>

### Dynamic branching and build time optimization

When you set up a keyword in a dynamic branching configuration, Unity does the following:

* At build time, Unity compiles a single shader program that includes all the branching code.
* At runtime, Unity sends all keyword states to the GPU for each draw call.

The impacts are the following:

* It keeps build times low and file sizes small.
* If your code has a lot of condition checks and complex branches, it might negatively impact GPU performance.

To configure a keyword for dynamic branching, set its [**Definition** parameter](Keywords-reference.md#common-parameters) to **Dynamic Branch**.

<a name="shader-variants"></a>

### Shader variants and runtime optimization

When you set up a keyword in a shader variant configuration:

* At build time, Unity compiles multiple shader variants according to the number of branches and keywords you define in your shader graph. 
* At runtime, Unity sends the GPU the shader variant that matches the evaluation results.

The impacts are the following:

* It improves GPU performance at runtime compared to a dynamic branching configuration.
* It mostly negatively affects the build time, especially if you use many keywords, which might require Unity to generate millions or trillions of shader variants.

By default, Unity sets the keyword's [**Definition** parameter](Keywords-reference.md#common-parameters) to **Shader Feature** to only compile shader variants you use in your build and reduce build time. If you need all the shader variants in your build, for example because you need to change shader branches at runtime, use **Multi Compile** instead. However, this might significantly increase build time and file sizes.

> [!NOTE]
> When Unity strips out a variant in the build process, any attempt to use this variant at runtime results in a pink shader error.

# Understanding Adaptive Probe Volumes

An Adaptive Probe Volume is a group of [Light Probes](https://docs.unity3d.com/Manual/LightProbes.html) that Unity places automatically based on the geometry density in your Scene, to create baked indirect lighting. You can use Adaptive Probe Volumes instead of manually placing and configuring Light Probes.

## Advantages and limitations

| **Feature** | **Light Probe Groups** | **Adaptive Probe Volumes** |
|---|---|---|
| Selection of surrounding probes | Per GameObject | Per pixel |
| Optimize memory use with streaming | No | Yes |
| Place probes automatically | No | Yes  |
| Blend between different bakes | No | Yes |
| Place probes manually |  Yes  | No |

Adaptive Probe Volumes have the following advantages:

- Unity samples surrounding probes per-pixel rather than per GameObject. This sampling approach results in better lighting consistency, and fewer seams between adjacent GameObjects.
- If you use [volumetric fog](create-a-local-fog-effect.md), the per-pixel probe selection provides more accurate lighting for the variations in a fog mass.
- You can adjust Light Probe layouts across a scene, for example using a denser set of Light Probes in an interior area with more detailed lighting or geometry. Refer to [Configure the size and density of Adaptive Probe Volumes](probevolumes-changedensity.md) for more information.
- Adaptive Probe Volumes work well if you [work with multiple scenes](https://docs.unity3d.com/Manual/MultiSceneEditing.html). Refer to [Baking Sets](probevolumes-concept.md#baking-sets) for more information.
- Because Adaptive Probe Volumes can cover a whole scene, screen space effects can fall back to Light Probes to get lighting data from GameObjects that are off-screen or occluded. Refer to [Screen Space Global Illumination](Override-Screen-Space-GI.md) for more information.
- Unity can use the data in Adaptive Probe Volumes to adjust lighting from Reflection Probes so it more closely matches the local environment, which reduces the number of Reflection Probes you need. Refer to [Frame Settings properties](frame-settings-reference.md).
- Adaptive Probe Volumes include [streaming](probevolumes-streaming.md) functionality to support large open worlds.
- You can use Adaptive Probe Volumes to [update light from the sky at runtime with sky occlusion](probevolumes-skyocclusion.md).

![Two comparison scenes of a red car model. The left scene uses Light Probe Groups, so each part of the car is a different shade of red. The right scene uses Adaptive Probe Volumes, so each part of the car is the same shade of red. ](Images/probevolumes-per-pixel.png)<br/>
The car model is made up of separate GameObjects. The left scene uses Light Probe Groups, which use per-object lighting, so each part of the car samples a single blended probe value. The right scene uses Adaptive Probe Volumes, which use per-pixel lighting, so each part of the car samples its nearest probes. This image uses the ArchVizPRO Photostudio HDRP asset from the Unity Asset Store.

![Left: Reflection Probe Normalization is disabled. Right: Reflection Probe Normalization is enabled.](Images/probevolumes-reflection-probe-normalization.png)<br/>
In the left scene, Reflection Probe Normalization is disabled. In the right scene, Reflection Probe Normalization is enabled, and there's less specular light leaking on the kitchen cabinet. This image uses the ArchVizPRO Interior Vol.5 HDRP asset from the Unity Asset Store.

Adaptive Probe Volumes have the following limitations:

- You can't adjust the locations of Light Probes inside an Adaptive Probe Volume. You can use settings and overrides to try to fix visible artifacts, but it might not be possible to make sure Light Probes follow walls or are at the exact boundary between different lighting areas. Refer to [Fix issues with Adaptive Probe Volumes](probevolumes-fixissues.md) for more information.
- You can't convert [Light Probe Groups](https://docs.unity3d.com/Manual/LightProbes.html) into an Adaptive Probe Volume.

## How Adaptive Probe Volumes work

HDRP automatically fills an Adaptive Probe Volume with a 3D structure of 'bricks'. Each brick contains 64 Light Probes, arranged in a 4 × 4 × 4 grid.

HDRP uses bricks with different sizes to match the amount of geometry in different areas of your scene. For example, in areas with more geometry, HDRP uses small bricks with a short distance between Light Probes. The Light Probes capture lighting at a higher resolution, so lighting is more accurate.

The default Light Probe spacing is 1, 3, 9, or 27 m.

![Purple volumes contain Light Probes spaced 1 meter apart. Large blue bricks contain Light Probes spaced 3 meters apart.](Images/probevolumes-debug-displayprobebricks1.PNG)<br/>
In this screenshot from the Rendering Debugger, the small purple bricks contain Light Probes spaced 1 meter apart, to capture data from high-geometry areas. The large blue bricks contain Light Probes spaced 3 meters apart, to capture data from areas with less geometry.

Each pixel of a GameObject samples lighting data from the eight closest Light Probes around it.

You can do the following:

- Use the Rendering Debugger to visualize the layout of bricks and Light Probes. Refer to [Display Adaptive Probe Volumes](probevolumes-showandadjust.md).
- [Configure the size and density of Adaptive Probe Volumes](probevolumes-changedensity.md).
- [Add a Volume to your scene](probevolumes-fixissues.md#volume) to adjust which Light Probes GameObjects sample.

<a name="baking-sets"></a>
## Baking Sets

To store lighting from a scene in an Adaptive Probe Volume, the scene must be part of a Baking Set.

A Baking Set contains the following:

- One or more scenes, which optionally include Adaptive Probe Volumes.
- A single collection of settings.

By default, HDRP uses **Single Scene** mode, and places each scene in its own Baking Set automatically. However, only one Baking Set can be active at any time, so if you [work with multiple scenes](https://docs.unity3d.com/Manual/MultiSceneEditing.html), you must add these scenes to a single Baking Set if you want to bake them together. Refer to [Bake multiple scenes together with Baking Sets](probevolumes-usebakingsets.md) for more information.

<a name="lighting-scenarios"></a>
### Lighting Scenarios

A Lighting Scenario asset contains the baked lighting data for a scene or Baking Set. You can bake different lighting setups into different Lighting Scenario assets, and change which one HDRP uses at runtime, or blend between them.

Refer to [Bake different lighting setups with Lighting Scenarios](probevolumes-bakedifferentlightingsetups.md) for more information.

#### How Lighting Scenarios store data

Adaptive Probe Volumes splits Lighting Scenario data into two parts, to avoid duplicating data:

- The shared data, which contains mainly the scene subdivision information and probe placement.
- The per scenario data, which contains the probe lighting information.

HDRP can't share the data or blend between Lighting Scenarios if you move geometry between bakes, because the Light Probe positions might change. Refer to [Keep Light Probes the same in different Lighting Scenarios](probevolumes-bakedifferentlightingsetups.md#keep-light-probes-the-same-in-different-lighting-scenarios) for more information.

--- CONTRIBUTING.md ---
# Contributions

## If you are interested in contributing, here are some ground rules:
* Talk to us before doing the work -- we love contributions, but we might already be working on the same thing, or we might have different opinions on how it should be implemented.
* Everything must have test coverage. PRs with insufficient test coverage will be rejected.
* A formatting job will run automatically on your PR, even while in draft. This gives you a chance to fix the formatting before marking your PR as "Ready for Review".

## All contributions are subject to the Unity Contribution Agreement

By making a pull request, you are confirming agreement to the terms and conditions of the [Unity Contribution Agreement](https://unity3d.com/legal/licenses/Unity_Contribution_Agreement), including that your Contributions are your original creation and that you have complete right and authority to make your Contributions.

## Rules for PRs

* If a PR shall not be merged (yet), the author should create a draft PR instead. As soon as the PR is considered ready to land, it should be turned into a usual PR by the author.
* Things to check while your PR is in draft:
    * Is your PR pointing at the correct branch?
    * Have you missed anything? Consider getting a review while the PR is still in draft.
    * Do you need to add any extra tests?

* Yamato pipelines will start once your PR is marked as "Ready For Review". The pipelines that start depend on what changed in your PR.
    * These jobs will start again on each push. Please keep your PR in draft if you have additional pushes to make to avoid starting too many jobs.
    * Please add `[cancel old ci]` to your commit message if you want the previous jobs to stop (ie if your new change overrides them)

* Please try to keep your branch as close to master as possible, and merge in master before running tests.

* If there were significant changes to the code after a reviewer approved, a re-review must be requested. For smaller changes (like fixing typos) this is not required.

* The PR author is expected to merge the PR. If the author wants the last approving reviewer to merge it instead, this should be explicitly communicated. There is no guideline on how that communication should happen (on GitHub, Slack or even verbally - whatever makes the most sense in the given situation and scope) but it must always be clear to all reviewers if they are expected to merge.

* A reviewer should not feel nitpicky about requesting (small) changes in a PR, this guideline explicitly encourages this -- also this kind of feedback adds to the quality of our product and it should not be taken personal. Here is a suggestion for a "fast path" though: the reviewer should suggest a solution (like a different phrasing, name or hinting a typo). If the author resolves those exactly as the reviewer suggested, he or she can assume the approval of the reviewer without awaiting another explicit re-review/approval.


### Adding Reviewers

* Each request needs **at least 1 reviewer**. Each reviewer needs to approve the PR before it is merged. People from the team can add themselves if they would also like to review the changes. Reviewers can be removed if they have not yet started a review, but do not remove people who have added themselves.

* For each reviewer added, **reach out to that person on Slack** so that they are made aware of the request.

* As a Reviewer, please **comment on or approve a PR in a timely manner**. If you’re unable to do so, reach out to the author and let them know.

* As the PR author you are responsible for landing your PR swiftly. Reach out to devs who do not review in a timely manner on slack and remind them.

## Stale PRs

PRs without activity for several days should be **updated with comments or closed**. If the PR is waiting on something (e.g. another merge), close the PR and reopen it later. If the PR has yet to be reviewed by the reviewer(s), double check that they are the best person to review this PR.

## Guidelines

* Aim for not more than 200 to 400 lines of changes in a PR. Beyond that, reviewers often stop trying to fully understand the code.
* Try to separate large automated-refactoring resulting in massive code changes from actual changes in separate PRs.
* Release Notes must be updated when behaviour is changed.

### Resolving comments guidelines
* Comments that were simply fixed exactly as the reviewer requested can be resolved by both author and reviewer
* Comments that the author has either disagreed with or solved in an unexpected way, should be resolved by the reviewer only (not the the author)

## Merging PRs

It’s preferred to **squash commits and merge** when completing a PR. To do so, click the dropdown arrow next to the merge button and select "Squash and merge". This will allow you to preview the new commit message and edit it.

Select another merge option if it’s required to preserve valuable information. For more information about the different merge options, see [GitHub’s documentation](https://help.github.com/articles/about-merge-methods-on-github/).

**Replace the merge commit message** with something meaning instead of using the default “merge pull request #123”.

Merged branches will automatically be deleted through GitHub (you can restore them if required).

- Fixed a numerical error of ComputeEdgeFactor(V1, V2) when two vectors are colinear.
- Fixed potential data corruption due to incorrect native render pass store action in NRP compiler.
- Added stencil flag to read-only depth logic in NRP compiler to avoid unintentional usage of depth read and stencil write states on some APIs.
- Added more error checking to `RenderGraph.ImportTexture` to prevent importing RenderTextures that have both color and depth.
An exception will now be thrown in this case.
- Fixed  an issue when using multiple AddBlitPass would binds the _BlitTexture wrongly.
- Modified TextureDesc so it can now use GraphicsFormat to set the depthStencil format (TextureDesc.format). The TextureDesc.depthBufferBits and TextureDesc.colorFormat fields are now properties that call GraphicsFormatUtilities functions for backwards compatibility. The descriptor now unambiguously describes a single resource, either color or depth. Therefore, TextureHandle clearly represents a single resource.
- Modified RTHandle allocators so they can now use GraphicsFormat to set the depthStencil format (TextureDesc.format). The allocators take a single format for either color or depth stencil to avoid incorrectly creating depth instead of color or vice versa.

This version is compatible with Unity 6000.0.0b15.

### Changed
- Added new visual effects examples to the HDRP Water Sample example scenes.
- Optimized the performance of reflection probe baking by baking all probes in a single batch.
- Improved HDRP build time.
- Optimized the color pyramid GPU time in HDRP.
- Improved scene culling performance when APV is enabled in the project.

- Fixed offset in refraction in XR.
- Fixed an issue where internally created Game Objects were being deallocated on scene changes.

- Fixed artifacts on low resolution SSGI when dynamic resolution values are low.
- Added an option to fix atmosphere when camera is in space.
- Fixed errors from HDRP material inspector when URP is active.
- Fixed missing VFX node to fetch water height at a given point.
- Fixed shadow flickering when dynamic resolution is enabled.
- Fixed a performance regression in area light evaluation code.
- Optimize the OnDisable of DecalProjector component when disabling a lot of decals at the same time.
- Removed the error message "Decal texture atlas out of space..." in release builds (it now only appears in the Editor or Development Builds).
- Fixed fog scattering that didn't take in account the scene color.
- Fixed lens flare occlusion not taking in account the volumetric fog for the sun.
- Updated HDRP shaders to be HLSL2021 compliant.
- Fixed interaction between on demand shadow rendering and enable/disable of the light source.
- Fixed color pyramid perf on GPU using too many threads.
- Fixed volumetric fog not rendering underwater.
- Fixed coarse stencil bug computation race condition caused by a compiler bug in DXC.
The issue manifests itself as flickering tiles on sub surface scatter pixels. This issue is caused because the DXC compiler does not make the branches using a groupThreadId vector comparison a scalar. Changing this to use the group index instead (preflattened) triggers the compiler to recognize the branch as a scalar instead.

- Fixed memory leak when virtual texture is used on dx12 (consoles and PC).
- Fixed correct resolution for refractive color pyramid sampling with DRS.

When hardware DRS is on, we can safely assume that the ratio between the input and output textures is 1 because the GPU hardware sizes are watertight.
- Fixed a warning that displayed when opening a template.
- Fixed issues with dynamic resolution when using FSR 1.0 and Depth of Field.
- Fixed an issue where global mip bias was updated 12 times during a frame in HDRP even when the value doesn't change.

- Fixed a performance issue with reflection probe inspector.
- Remove unnecessary shader variants of decal raytracing shaders.
- Fixed potential leaks when using dynamic resolution and objects with refraction.
- Correct dynamic resolution settings for offscreen UI.

- Fixed Box Light appearance in HDRP Path Tracing.
- Fixed tube area lights seemingly scattering light in a single hemisphere with volumetric fog and disappearing volumetric fog effect on area lights depending on the number of activated ones.
- Fixed triplanar on alpha clipped geometry.
- Fixed a crash on FSR 2 dx12. In dx12, the FSR2 plugin requires to use the ExecuteCommandList public api from IUnityGraphicsD3D12v7. This event is ran on the submission thread. Because we are in the submission thread, we are not allowed to call TextureFromNativeTexture because it depends on an internal active command buffer to be alive. Which might not be the case! this is then a race condition.
- Fixed an issue where the Mipmap Streaming debug views would show up incorrectly when certain features were enabled (SRP Batcher, Volumetric Fog, Volumetric Clouds, ...).

- Added "Include for Path Tracing" checkbox on lights, ensured "Include for Ray Tracing" checkbox is visible on supported lights.
- Fixed autoregistered diffusion profiles not getting applied immediately.
- Fixing jittered inverse view projection in line rendering: because shading in high quality line rendering (i.e. hair rendering) is done in object space, the unjittered inverse view projection matrix has been added to the matrix constant buffer and is now used for shading hair.
- Async compute Presents issues when depending on the first texture read of depth. In some platforms (vulkan/dx12 and some consoles) the first read of depth is actually a write because of decompression / layout / barriers.
  Async compute is inserting the fence before this operation because RenderGraph sees everything as a simple Read / Write.
  Temporarily hacking this so the first read of depth is tagged as a write, so the correct fence is inserted.
- Fix the scroll bar jumping at the top of the window when focusing a settings from the same panel in the project settings

## [3.1.0-preview] - 2018-01-01

### Added

- Decal now support per channel selection mask. There is now two mode. One with BaseColor, Normal and Smoothness and another one more expensive with BaseColor, Normal, Smoothness, Metal and AO. Control is on HDRP Asset. This may require to launch an update script for old scene: 'Edit/Render Pipeline/Single step upgrade script/Upgrade all DecalMaterial MaskBlendMode'.
- Decal now supports depth bias for decal mesh, to prevent z-fighting
- Decal material now supports draw order for decal projectors
- Added LightLayers support (Base on mask from renderers name RenderingLayers and mask from light name LightLayers - if they match, the light apply) - cost an extra GBuffer in deferred (more bandwidth)
- When LightLayers is enabled, the AmbientOclusion is store in the GBuffer in deferred path allowing to avoid double occlusion with SSAO. In forward the double occlusion is now always avoided.
- Added the possibility to add an override transform on the camera for volume interpolation

- Replace the sampler used for density volumes for correct wrap mode handling

### Changed

- Move Rendering Debugger "Windows from Windows->General-> Rendering Debugger windows" to "Windows from Windows->Analysis-> Rendering Debugger windows"
- Update detail map formula for smoothness and albedo, goal it to bright and dark perceptually and scale factor is use to control gradient speed
- Refactor the Upgrade material system. Now a material can be update from older version at any time. Call Edit/Render Pipeline/Upgrade all Materials to newer version
- Change name EnableDBuffer to EnableDecals at several place (shader, hdrp asset...), this require a call to Edit/Render Pipeline/Upgrade all Materials to newer version to have up to date material.
- Refactor shader code: BakeLightingData structure have been replace by BuiltinData. Lot of shader code have been remove/change.
- Refactor shader code: All GBuffer are now handled by the deferred material. Mean ShadowMask and LightLayers are control by lit material in lit.hlsl and not outside anymore. Lot of shader code have been remove/change.
- Refactor shader code: Rename GetBakedDiffuseLighting to ModifyBakedDiffuseLighting. This function now handle lighting model for transmission too. Lux meter debug mode is factor outisde.
- Refactor shader code: GetBakedDiffuseLighting is not call anymore in GBuffer or forward pass, including the ConvertSurfaceDataToBSDFData and GetPreLightData, this is done in ModifyBakedDiffuseLighting now
- Refactor shader code: Added a backBakeDiffuseLighting to BuiltinData to handle lighting for transmission

- Opacity as Density blending feature for Terrain Lit Shader is now disabled when the Terrain has more than four Terrain Layers. This is now similar to the Height-blend feature for the Terrain Lit Shader.
- DepthNormals passes now sample normal maps if used on the material, otherwise output the geometry normal.
- SSAO Texture is now R8 instead of ARGB32 if supported by the platform.
- Enabled subsurface scattering with GI on handwritten Universal ST8 shader.
- Material upgrader now also upgrades AnimationClips in the project that have curves bound to renamed material properties.
- 2D Lights now inherit from Light2DBase.
- The behavior of setting a camera's Background Type to "Dont Care" has changed on mobile. Previously, "Dont Care" would behave identically to "Solid Color" on mobile. Now, "Dont Care" corresponds to the render target being filled with arbitrary data at the beginning of the frame, which may be faster in some situations. Note that there are no guarantees for the exact content of the render target, so projects should use "Dont care" only if they are guaranteed to render to, or otherwise write every pixel every frame.
- Stripping shader variants per renderer features instead of combined renderer features.
- When MSAA is enabled and a depth texture is required, the opaque pass depth will be copied instead of scheduling a depth prepass.

### Removed

- Code to upgrade from LWRP to URP was removed. This means if you want to upgrade from LWRP you must first upgrade to previous versions of URP and then upgrade to this version.

## [11.0.0] - 2020-10-21

### Added

- Added real-time Point Light Shadows.
- Added a supported MSAA samples count check, so the actual supported MSAA samples count value can be assigned to RenderTexture descriptors.
- Added the TerrainCompatible SubShader Tag. Use this Tag in your custom shader to tell Unity that the shader is compatible with the Terrain system.
- Added \_CameraSortingLayerTexture global shader variable and related parameters
- Added preset shapes for creating a freeform light
- Added serialization of Freeform ShapeLight mesh to avoid CPU cost of generating them on the runtime.
- Added 2D Renderer Asset Preset for creating a Universal Renderer Asset
- Added an option to use faster, but less accurate approximation functions when converting between the sRGB and Linear color spaces.
- Added screen space shadow as renderer feature
- Added [DisallowMultipleRendererFeature] attribute for Renderer Features.
- Added support for Enlighten precomputed realtime Global Illumination.

### Changed

- Optimized 2D Renderer performance on mobile GPUs by reducing the number of render target switches.
- Optimized 2D Renderer performance by rendering the normal buffer at the same lower resolution as the light buffers.
- Improved Light2D UI/UX
- Improved 2D Menu layout
- Deprecated Light2D Parametric Light
- Deprecated Light2D point light cookie
- Renamed Light2D point light to spot light
- 2D Renderer: The per Blend Style render texture scale setting was replaced by a global scale setting for all Blend Styles.
- Optimized 2D Renderer performance by using a tiny light texture for layer/blend style pairs for which no light is rendered.
- Reorgnized the settings in 2D Renderer Data Inspector.
- FallOff Lookup Texture is now part of 2D RenderData.
- Creating a Shadow Caster 2D will use try and use sprite and physics bounds as the default shape
- Deleting all points in a Shadow Caster will cause the shape to use the bounds.
- Improved Geometry for Smooth Falloff of 2D Shape Lights.
- Updated the tooltips for Light 2D Inspector.
- Removed the Custom blend Mode option from the Blend Styles.
- New default Blend Styles when a new 2D Renderer Data asset is created.
- Added a supported MSAA samples count check, so the actual supported MSAA samples count value can be assigned to RenderTexture descriptors.
- Bloom in Gamma color-space now more closely matches Linear color-space, this will mean project using Bloom and Gamma color-space may need to adjust Bloom Intensity to match previous look.
- Autodesk Interactive Shader Graph files and folders containing them were renamed. The new file paths do not have spaces.
- Moved `FinalPostProcessPass` to `AfterRenderingPostProcessing` event from `AfterRendering`. This allows user pass to execute before and after `FinalPostProcessPass` and `CapturePass` to capture everything.
- Changed shader keywords of main light shadow from toggling to enumerating.
- Always use "High" quality normals, which normalizes the normal in pixel shader. "Low" quality normals looked too much like a bug.
- Re-enabled implicit MSAA resolve to backbuffer on Metal MacOS.
- Optimized 2D performance by rendering straight to the backbuffer if possible
- Changed Post Process Data to bool. When it is no enabled all post processing is stripped from build, when it is enabled you can still override resources there.
- Converted XR automated tests to use MockHMD.
- Improved 2D Renderer performance on mobile GPUs when using MSAA
- Reduced the size of the fragment input struct of the Terrain and Forward lighting shaders.

## [10.0.0] - 2020-06-10

### Added

- Added the option to strip Terrain hole Shader variants.
- Added support for additional Directional Lights. The amount of additional Directional Lights is limited by the maximum Per-object Lights in the Render Pipeline Asset.
- Added Package Samples: 2 Camera Stacking, 2 Renderer Features
- Added default implementations of OnPreprocessMaterialDescription for FBX, Obj, Sketchup and 3DS file formats.
- Added Transparency Sort Mode and Transparency Sort Axis to 2DRendererData.
- Added support for a user defined default material to 2DRendererData.
- Added the option to toggle shadow receiving on transparent objects.
- Added XR multipass rendering. Multipass rendering is a requirement on many VR platforms and allows graceful fallback when single-pass rendering isn't available.
- Added support for Camera Stacking when using the Forward Renderer. This introduces the Camera `Render Type` property. A Base Camera can be initialized with either the Skybox or Solid Color, and can combine its output with that of one or more Overlay Cameras. An Overlay Camera is always initialized with the contents of the previous Camera that rendered in the Camera Stack.
- Added AssetPostprocessors and Shadergraphs to handle Arnold Standard Surface and 3DsMax Physical material import from FBX.
- Added `[MainTexture]` and `[MainColor]` shader property attributes to URP shader properties. These will link script material.mainTextureOffset and material.color to `_BaseMap` and `_BaseColor` shader properties.
- Added the option to specify the maximum number of visible lights. If you set a value, lights are sorted based on their distance from the Camera.
- Added the option to control the transparent layer separately in the Forward Renderer.
- Added the ability to set individual RendererFeatures to be active or not, use `ScriptableRendererFeature.SetActive(bool)` to set whether a Renderer Feature will execute, `ScriptableRendererFeature.isActive` can be used to check the current active state of the Renderer Feature.
  additional steps to the 2D Renderer setup page for quality and platform settings.
- If Unity Editor Analytics are enabled, Universal collects anonymous data about usage of Universal. This helps the Universal team focus our efforts on the most common scenarios, and better understand the needs of our customers.
- Added a OnCameraSetup() function to the ScriptableRenderPass API, that gets called by the renderer before rendering each camera
- Added a OnCameraCleanup() function to the ScriptableRenderPass API, that gets called by the renderer after rendering each camera
- Added Default Material Type options to the 2D Renderer Data Asset property settings.
- Added additional steps to the 2D Renderer setup page for quality and platform settings.
- Added option to disable XR autotests on test settings.
- Shader Preprocessor strips gbuffer shader variants if DeferredRenderer is not in the list of renderers in any Scriptable Pipeline Assets.
- Added an option to enable/disable Adaptive Performance when the Adaptive Performance package is available in the project.
- Added support for 3DsMax's 2021 Simplified Physical Material from FBX files in the Model Importer.
- Added GI to SpeedTree
- Added support for DXT5nm-style normal maps on Android, iOS and tvOS
- Added stencil override support for deferred renderer.
- Added a warning message when a renderer is used with an unsupported graphics API, as the deferred renderer does not officially support GL-based platforms.
- Added option to skip a number of final bloom iterations.
- Added support for [Screen Space Ambient Occlusion](https://docs.unity3d.com/Packages/com.unity.render-pipelines.universal@10.0/manual/post-processing-ssao.html) and a new shader variant \_SCREEN_SPACE_OCCLUSION.
- Added support for Normal Texture being generated in a prepass.
- Added a ConfigureInput() function to ScriptableRenderPass, so it is possible for passes to ask that a Depth, Normal and/or Opaque textures to be generated by the forward renderer.
- Added a float2 normalizedScreenSpaceUV to the InputData Struct.
- Added new sections to documentation: [Writing custom shaders](https://docs.unity3d.com/Packages/com.unity.render-pipelines.universal@10.0/manual/writing-custom-shaders-urp.html), and [Using the beginCameraRendering event](https://docs.unity3d.com/Packages/com.unity.render-pipelines.universal@10.0/manual/using-begincamerarendering.html).
- Added support for GPU instanced mesh particles on supported platforms.
- Added API to check if a Camera or Light is compatible with Universal Render Pipeline.

- The number of maximum visible lights is now determined by whether the platform is mobile or not.
- Renderer Feature list is now redesigned to fit more closely to the Volume Profile UI, this vastly improves UX and reliability of the Renderer Features List.
- Default color values for Lit and SimpleLit shaders changed to white due to issues with texture based workflows.
- You can now subclass ForwardRenderer to create a custom renderer based on it.
- URP is now computing tangent space per fragment.
- Optimized the 2D Renderer to skip rendering into certain internal buffers when not necessary.
- You can now subclass ForwardRenderer to create a custom renderer based on it.
- URP shaders that contain a priority slider now no longer have an offset of 50 by default.
- The virtual ScriptableRenderer.FrameCleanup() function has been marked obsolete and replaced by ScriptableRenderer.OnCameraCleanup() to better describe when the function gets invoked by the renderer.
- DepthOnlyPass, CopyDepthPass and CopyColorPass now use OnCameraSetup() instead of Configure() to set up their passes before executing as they only need to get their rendertextures once per camera instead of once per eye.
- Updated shaders to be compatible with Microsoft's DXC.
- Mesh GPU Instancing option is now hidden from the particles system renderer as this feature is not supported by URP.
- The 2D Renderer now supports camera stacking.
- 2D shaders now use half-precision floats whenever precise results are not necessary.
- Removed the ETC1_EXTERNAL_ALPHA variant from Shader Graph Sprite shaders.

## [7.1.1] - 2019-09-05

### Upgrade Guide

- The render pipeline now handles custom renderers differently. You must now set up renderers for the Camera on the Render Pipeline Asset.
- Render Pipeline Assets upgrades automatically and either creates a default forward renderer in your project or links the existing custom one that you've assigned.
- If you have custom renderers assigned to Cameras, you must now add them to the current Render Pipeline Asset. Then you can select which renderer to use on the Camera.

### Added

- Added shader function `GetMainLightShadowParams`. This returns a half4 for the main light that packs shadow strength in x component and shadow soft property in y component.
- Added shader function `GetAdditionalLightShadowParams`. This returns a half4 for an additional light that packs shadow strength in x component and shadow soft property in y component.
- Added a `Debug Level` option to the Render Pipeline Asset. With this, you can control the amount of debug information generated by the render pipeline.
- Added ability to set the `ScriptableRenderer` that the Camera renders with via C# using `UniversalAdditionalCameraData.SetRenderer(int index)`. This maps to the **Renderer List** on the Render Pipeline Asset.
- Added shadow support for the 2D Renderer.
- Added ShadowCaster2D, and CompositeShadowCaster2D components.
- Added shadow intensity and shadow volume intensity properties to Light2D.
- Added new Gizmos for Lights.
- Added CinemachineUniversalPixelPerfect, a Cinemachine Virtual Camera Extension that solves some compatibility issues between Cinemachine and Pixel Perfect Camera.
- Added an option that disables the depth/stencil buffer for the 2D Renderer.
- Added manipulation handles for the inner cone angle for spot lights.
- Added documentation for the built-in post-processing solution and Volumes framework (and removed incorrect mention of the PPv2 package).

### Changed

- Increased visible lights limit for the forward renderer. It now supports 256 visible lights except in mobile platforms. Mobile platforms support 32 visible lights.
- Increased per-object lights limit for the forward renderer. It now supports 8 per-object lights in all platforms except GLES2. GLES2 supports 4 per-object lights.
- The Sprite-Lit-Default shader and the Sprite Lit Shader Graph shaders now use the vertex tangents for tangent space calculations.
- Temporary render textures for cameras rendering to render textures now use the same format and multisampling configuration as camera's target texture.
- All platforms now use R11G11B10_UFloat format for HDR render textures if supported.
- There is now a list of `ScriptableRendererData` on the Render Pipeline Asset as opposed to a renderer type. These are available to all Cameras and are included in builds.
- The renderer override on the Camera is now an enum that maps to the list of `ScriptableRendererData` on the Render Pipeline Asset.
- Pixel Perfect Camera now allows rendering to a render texture.
- Light2D GameObjects that you've created now have a default position with z equal to 0.
- Documentation: Changed the "Getting Started" section into "Install and Configure". Re-arranged the Table of Content.

## [5.0.0-preview] - 2018-09-28

## [4.0.0-preview] - 2018-09-28

### Added

- Shader Graph now supports the High Definition Render Pipeline with both PBR and Unlit Master nodes. Shaders built with Shader Graph work with both the Lightweight and HD render pipelines.
- You can now modify vertex position via the Position slot on the PBR and Unlit Master nodes. By default, the input to this node is object space position. Custom inputs to this slot should specify the absolute local position of a given vertex. Certain nodes (such as Procedural Shapes) are not viable in the vertex shader. Such nodes are incompatible with this slot.
- You can now edit the Reference name for a property. To do so, select the property and type a new name next to Reference. If you want to reset to the default name, right-click Reference, and select Reset reference.
- In the expanded property window, you can now toggle whether the property is exposed.
- You can now change the path of Shader Graphs and Sub Graphs. When you change the path of a Shader Graph, this modifies the location it has in the shader selection list. When you change the path of Sub Graph, it will have a different location in the node creation menu.
- Added `Is Front Face` node. With this node, you can change graph output depending on the face sign of a given fragment. If the current fragment is part of a front face, the node returns true. For a back face, the node returns false. Note: This functionality requires that you have enabled **two sided** on the Master node.
- Gradient functionality is now available via two new nodes: Sample Gradient and Gradient Asset. The Sample Gradient node samples a gradient given a Time parameter. You can define this gradient on the Gradient slot control view. The Gradient Asset node defines a gradient that can be sampled by multiple Sample Gradient nodes using different Time parameters.
- Math nodes now have a Waves category. The category has four different nodes: Triangle wave, Sawtooth wave, Square wave, and Noise Sine wave. The Triangle, Sawtooth, and Square wave nodes output a waveform with a range of -1 to 1 over a period of 1. The Noise Sine wave outputs a standard Sine wave with a range of -1 to 1 over a period of 2 \* pi. For variance, random noise is added to the amplitude of the Sine wave, within a determined range.
- Added `Sphere Mask` node for which you can indicate the starting coordinate and center point. The sphere mask uses these with the **Radius** and **Hardness** parameters. Sphere mask functionality works in both 2D and 3D spaces, and is based on the vector coordinates in the **Coords and Center** input.
- Added support for Texture 3D and Texture 2D Array via two new property types and four new nodes.
- A new node `Texture 2D LOD` has been added for LOD functionality on a Texture 2D Sample. Sample Texture 2D LOD uses the exact same input and output slots as Sample Texture 2D, but also includes an input for level of detail adjustments via a Vector1 slot.
- Added `Texel Size` node, which allows you to get the special texture properties of a Texture 2D Asset via the `{texturename}_TexelSize` variable. Based on input from the Texture 2D Asset, the node outputs the width and height of the texel size in Vector1 format.
- Added `Rotate About Axis` node. This allows you to rotate a 3D vector space around an axis. For the rotation, you can specify an amount of degrees or a radian value.
- Unpacking normal maps in object space.
- Unpacking derivative maps option on sample texture nodes.
- Added Uint type for instancing support.
- Added HDR option for color material slots.
- Added definitions used by new HD Lit Master node.
- Added a popup control for a string list.
- Added conversion type (position/direction) to TransformNode.
- In your preview for nodes that are not master nodes, pixels now display as pink if they are not finite.

### Changed

- The settings for master nodes now live in a small window that you can toggle on and off. Here, you can change various rendering settings for your shader.
- There are two Normal Derive Nodes: `Normal From Height` and `Normal Reconstruct Z`.
  `Normal From Height` uses Vector1 input to derive a normal map.
  `Normal Reconstruct Z` uses the X and Y components in Vector2 input to derive the proper Z value for a normal map.
- The Texture type default input now accepts render textures.
- HD PBR subshader no longer duplicates surface description code into vertex shader.
- If the current render pipeline is not compatible, master nodes now display an error badge.
- The preview shader now only considers the current render pipeline. Because of this there is less code to compile, so the preview shader compiles faster.
- When you rename a shader graph or sub shader graph locally on your disk, the title of the Shader Graph window, black board, and preview also updates.
- Removed legacy matrices from Transfomation Matrix node.
- Texture 2D Array and Texture 3D nodes can no longer be used in the vertex shader.
- `Normal Create` node has been renamed to `Normal From Texture`.
- When you close the Shader Graph after you have modified a file, the prompt about saving your changes now shows the file name as well.
- `Blend` node now supports Overwrite mode.
- `Simple Noise` node no longer has a loop.
- The `Polygon` node now calculates radius based on apothem.
- `Normal Strength` node now calculates Z value more accurately.
- You can now connect Sub Graphs to vertex shader slots. If a node in the Sub Graph specifies a shader stage, that specific Sub Graph node is locked to that stage. When an instance of a Sub Graph node is connected to a slot that specifies a shader stage, all slots on that instance are locked to the stage.
- Separated material options and tags.
- Master node settings are now recreated when a topological modification occurs.

### Fixed

- Vector 1 nodes now evaluate correctly. ([#334](https://github.com/Unity-Technologies/ShaderGraph/issues/334) and [#337](https://github.com/Unity-Technologies/ShaderGraph/issues/337))
- Properties can now be copied and pasted.
- Pasting a property node into another graph will now convert it to a concrete node. ([#300](https://github.com/Unity-Technologies/ShaderGraph/issues/300) and [#307](https://github.com/Unity-Technologies/ShaderGraph/pull/307))
- Nodes that are copied from one graph to another now spawn in the center of the current view. ([#333](https://github.com/Unity-Technologies/ShaderGraph/issues/333))
- When you edit sub graph paths, the search window no longer yields a null reference exception.
- The blackboard is now within view when deserialized.
- Your system locale can no longer cause incorrect commands due to full stops being converted to commas.
- Deserialization of subgraphs now works correctly.
- Sub graphs are now suffixed with (sub), so you can tell them apart from other nodes.
- Boolean and Texture type properties now function correctly in sub-graphs.
- The preview of a node does not obstruct the selection outliner anymore.
- The Dielectric Specular node no longer resets its control values.
- You can now copy, paste, and duplicate sub-graph nodes with vector type input ports.

- `Normal Create` node has been renamed to `Normal From Texture`.
- The preview of nodes now updates correctly.
- Your system locale can no longer cause incorrect commands due to full stops being converted to commas.
- `Show Generated Code` no longer throws an "Argument cannot be null" error.
- Sub Graphs now use the correct generation mode when they generate preview shaders.

# Guidelines to merge with your custom changes

Breaking down the merges into 2 steps makes it more manageable:


1. First merge <last mainline commit before the restructure>:
    * Master: [fa006468e96219788e5bf60e8e887e3d3bd7557f](https://github.com/Unity-Technologies/Graphics/commit/fa006468e96219788e5bf60e8e887e3d3bd7557f)
    * 2022.1: [107fe47144883a35e93f6f2a88ee691d9059bdf3](https://github.com/Unity-Technologies/Graphics/commit/107fe47144883a35e93f6f2a88ee691d9059bdf3)
    * 2021.3: [ad85b534d7ac336305f8e0d87c02cc23cbcbd6be](https://github.com/Unity-Technologies/Graphics/commit/ad85b534d7ac336305f8e0d87c02cc23cbcbd6be)
2. Then merge the actual restructured mainline

In case you want to merge `<branch>` into `<mainline>`, it’s safer to first merge `<mainline>` into `<branch>` than the other way around. ([https://stackoverflow.com/a/57313561/5804755](https://stackoverflow.com/a/57313561/5804755)). Side effect: you now have `<mainline>` into `<branch>`.


# Solution


1. `git checkout <branch>`
2. `git merge <last mainline commit before the restructure> // deal with "regular" Merge Conflicts`
3. Manually restructure the repo as was done on the mainline (described above). This can be done via the file explorer or if you feel more adventurous, via script (your mileage may vary depending on your OS - it may just be easier to do it by hand)
4. `git add .`
5. `git commit -m "Apply new structure"`
6. `git merge -s ours <mainline>`
7. // If you want to merge <branch> into the mainline

    ```
    git checkout <mainline>
    git merge <branch>

## NOTE: We have migrated reported issues to FogBugz. You can only log further issues via the Unity bug tracker. To see how, read [this](https://unity3d.com/unity/qa/bug-reporting).

## NOTE 2: Development by Unity developers happens in an private repo. Changes are mirrored from that private repo to this public repo every few weeks. [This](https://forum.unity.com/threads/important-upcoming-changes-to-the-graphics-repository.1239826/) forum thread can be used to discuss the mirroring.

# Unity Scriptable Render Pipeline
The Scriptable Render Pipeline (SRP) is a Unity feature designed to give artists and developers the tools they need to create modern, high-fidelity graphics in Unity. Unity provides two pre-built Scriptable Render Pipelines:

* The Universal Render Pipeline (URP) for use on all platforms.
* The High Definition Render Pipeline (HDRP) for use on compute shader compatible platforms.

Unity is committed to an open and transparent development process for SRP and the pre-built Render Pipelines. This means that you can browse this repository to see what features are currently in development.

For more information about the packages in this repository, see the following:

* [Scriptable Render Pipeline Core](https://docs.unity3d.com/Packages/com.unity.render-pipelines.core@latest/index.html)
* [High Definition Render Pipeline](https://docs.unity3d.com/Packages/com.unity.render-pipelines.high-definition@latest/index.html)
* [Universal Render Pipeline](https://docs.unity3d.com/Packages/com.unity.render-pipelines.universal@latest/index.html)
* [Shader Graph](https://docs.unity3d.com/Packages/com.unity.shadergraph@latest/index.html)
* [Visual Effect Graph](https://docs.unity3d.com/Packages/com.unity.visualeffectgraph@latest/index.html)

## Branches and package releases

The packages in this repository are distributed as [Core packages](https://docs.unity3d.com/Manual/pack-core.html) in the Unity editor.
The package vendoring process happens multiple times in each Unity release. The vendoring happens from the latest changeset of the release branch for each Unity release.
A tag is generated on the changeset used to vendor a specific Unity release.

Release branches are defined as follows:
- **master** branch is used for main developement and it always maps to the latest **Unity Alpha** release.
- **{unity-version}/staging** maps to beta and released Unity versions. f.ex, **2021.1/staging** maps to Unity 2021.1.
- **{package-major-version}.x.x/release** is used for Unity 2020.x and below. f.ex, **10.x.x/release** maps to Unity 2020.3 LTS.

If you need to find if a specific changeset is included in a specific Unity version, you can search tags for the Unity version.
On GitHub, you can do that by clicking on the **Branch** drop-down then clicking the **Tags** tab. Typing `2021.2` will list all changesets tagged to each Unity version.

## Modifying package source

You can download and install the packages of this repositories on your Unity project and modify the package source code.
You can do that by one of the following methods:

1. Clone this repository in any folder on your computer. [Install them as local packages](https://docs.unity3d.com/Manual/upm-ui-local.html) into your project.
2. Clone this repository inside a `Packages` folder in your Unity project.

## Package versions on Unity 2020.3 LTS and below

On Unity 2020.3 LTS and below, the packages in this repository were not Core packages. Instead they were regular packages and different versions could be installed to different versions of Unity.
The compatibility of Unity versions and package versions were as follows:

- **Unity 2023.3 is compatible with SRP versions 17.x.x**
- **Unity 2023.2 is compatible with SRP versions 16.x.x**
- **Unity 2023.1 is compatible with SRP versions 15.x.x**
- **Unity 2022.2/3 is compatible with SRP versions 14.x.x**
- **Unity 2022.1 is compatible with SRP versions 13.x.x**
- **Unity 2021.2/3 is compatible with SRP versions 12.x.x**
- **Unity 2021.1 is compatible with SRP versions 11.x.x**
- **Unity 2020.2 is compatible with SRP versions 10.x.x**
- **Unity 2020.1 is compatible with SRP versions 8.x.x**
- **Unity 2019.3 is compatible with SRP versions 7.x.x**
- **Unity 2019.2 is compatible with SRP versions 6.x.x**
- **Unity 2019.1 is compatible with SRP versions 5.x.x**

The above list is a guideline for major versions of SRP, but there are often multiple minor versions that you can use for a certain version of Unity. To determine which minor versions of SRP you can use:

1. In your Unity Project, open the Package Manager window (menu: **Window > Package Manager**).
2. In the list of packages, find **Core RP Library**. To find this package in older versions of Unity, you may need to expose preview packages. To do this, click the **Advanced** button at the top of the window then, in the context menu, click **Show preview packages**.
3. Click the drop-down arrow to the left of the package entry then click **See all versions**. This shows a list that contains every package version compatible with your version of Unity.

After you decide which version of SRP to use:

1. Go to the [Unity Graphics repository](https://github.com/Unity-Technologies/Graphics).
2. Click the **Branch** drop-down then click the **Tags** tab.
3. Find the tag that corresponds to the version of SRP you want to use. When you clone the repository, you use this tag to check out the correct branch.

## PR workflow guidelines
- Consider making use of **draft PRs** if you are not 100% sure that your PR is ready for review
- Adding [skip ci] (case insensitive) to the title of PRs will stop any jobs being triggered automatically - you will need to open Yamato and find your branch to run ABV
- You can also add [skip ci] to commit messages to prevent CI from running on that push
- Add [cancel old ci] to your commit message if you've made changes you want to test and no longer need the previous jobs

## Reminders
- Have you added a backport label (if needed)?
  
  > *For example, the `need-backport-*` label. After you backport the PR, the label changes to `backported-*`.*
- Have you updated the changelog?
  
  > *Each package has a `CHANGELOG.md` file.*
- Have you updated or added the documentation for your PR?
  
  > *When you add a new feature, change a property name, or change the behavior of a feature, it's best practice to include related documentation changes in the same PR.*
- Have you added a graphic test for your PR (if needed)?
  
  > *When you add a new feature, or discover a bug that tests don't cover, please add a graphic test.*

# Shader Graph

![Screenshot of Shader Graph](https://forum.unity.com/proxy.php?image=https%3A%2F%2Flh5.googleusercontent.com%2FUhB18UehZFk8jMo_2V3GW-hD2wARAcQWu6FGzcUvTByHNc51w_mLZBvB6Re5GcTHJQlPHOtzi14wUPvi_yUgWTAp3-HZU463JmxL9NSjJS5yALBSAj1Bdk8yL8zXkRVe-0crKz5F&hash=49458e7088a5be61b288167af65b6faf "Shader Graph")

A Shader Graph enables you to build shaders visually. Instead of hand writing code you create and connect nodes in a graph network. The graph framework gives instant feedback on the changes, and it’s simple enough that new users can become involved in shader creation.

Unless you intend to modify Shader Graph or want to try out the latest and unsupported features, Unity recommends that you install Shader Graph through the Unity Package Manager:

1. Open a Unity project.
2. Open the **Package Manager** window (**Window** &gt; **Package Manager**).
3. In the **Package Manager** window, in the **Packages** menu, select **Unity Registry**.
4. Do one of the following, based on your project needs:
    - To use Shader Graph and the [Universal Render Pipeline (URP)](https://docs.unity3d.com/Manual/urp/urp-introduction.html) in your project, select **Universal RP**.
    - To use Shader Graph and the [High Definition Render Pipeline (HDRP)](https://docs.unity3d.com/Packages/com.unity.render-pipelines.high-definition@latest), select **High Definition RP**.
    - To use Shader Graph with Unity's [Built-In Render Pipeline](https://docs.unity3d.com/2020.3/Documentation/Manual/built-in-render-pipeline.html), select **Shader Graph**.

Unity recommends using Shader Graph with URP or HDRP.

## Instructions

If you want to try out the latest features, we recommend obtaining the most recent version of Shader Graph through the [Unity Scriptable Render Pipeline (SRP) repository](https://github.com/Unity-Technologies/Graphics), which includes the Shader Graph project as a Git submodule. For more information on Git submodules, see [Git's documentation on Submodules](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Git-Tools-Submodules).

If you don't install Shader Graph through the SRP repository, you don't have any Master Node backends available and your shaders are invalid. Invalid shaders appear pink in the Unity Editor. Installing through the repository also ensures you have a compatible set of render pipeline and Shader Graph versions.

For more detailed instructions for installing from the repository, see the [SRP repository's README](https://github.com/Unity-Technologies/Graphics/blob/master/README.md).

# SRP Core

The Scriptable Render Pipeline (SRP) is a Unity feature that allows you to write C# scripts to control the way Unity renders each frame. SRP Core is a package that makes it easier to create or customize an SRP.

SRP Core contains reusable code, including boilerplate code for working with platform-specific graphics APIs, utility functions for common rendering operations, and the shader libraries used in the High Definition Render Pipeline (HDRP) and Universal Render Pipeline (URP).

If you are creating a custom SRP from scratch or customizing a prebuilt SRP, using SRP Core will save you time.

For more information on SRP, including a guide to getting started with a custom SRP, see the [SRP documentation](https://docs.unity3d.com/Manual/ScriptableRenderPipeline.html). For more information on Unity's prebuilt SRPs, see the [Universal Render Pipeline (URP) documentation](https://docs.unity3d.com/Manual/urp/urp-introduction.html), or the [High Definition Render Pipeline (HDRP) documentation](https://docs.unity3d.com/Packages/com.unity.render-pipelines.high-definition@latest).

# High Definition Render Pipeline overview

![A sample scene rendered with the High Definition Render Pipeline.](Images/Index1Main.png)

The High Definition Render Pipeline (HDRP) is a high-fidelity Scriptable Render Pipeline built by Unity to target modern (Compute Shader compatible) platforms.

HDRP utilizes physically based Lighting techniques, linear lighting, HDR lighting, and a configurable hybrid Tile/Cluster deferred/Forward lighting architecture. It gives you the tools you need to create applications such as games, technical demos, and animations to a high graphical standard.

**Note**: Projects that you make with HDRP aren't compatible with the Universal Render Pipeline (URP). You must decide which render pipeline your Project uses before you start development; HDRP features aren't cross-compatible between HDRP and URP.

This documentation contains the information you need to create applications using HDRP; including information on Lighting, Materials and Shaders, Cameras, and debugging.

For information on platform support and system requirements, see [System Requirements](System-Requirements.md).

# Shader Graph

Shader Graph enables you to build shaders visually. Instead of writing code, you create and connect nodes in a graph framework. Shader Graph gives instant feedback that reflects your changes, and it’s simple enough for users who are new to shader creation.

Shader Graph is automatically available in your project as soon as you install the [Universal Render Pipeline (URP)](https://docs.unity3d.com/Manual/urp/urp-introduction.html) or the [High Definition Render Pipeline (HDRP)](https://docs.unity3d.com/Packages/com.unity.render-pipelines.high-definition@latest). Refer to [Shader Graph installation details](install-shader-graph.md).

# About _High Definition Project Template_

This template is a good starting point for people focused on high-end graphics that want to develop games for platforms that support Shader Model 5.0 (DX11 and above).
This template utilizes the High Definition Render Pipeline, a modern rendering pipeline that includes advanced material types and a configurable hybrid tile/cluster deferred/forward lighting architecture.
This template also includes the new Shadergraph tool, Post-Processing stack, several Presets to jump start development, and example content.

This Project Template uses the following features:

* High Definition Render Pipeline - For more information, see the [HDRP documentation](https://docs.unity3d.com/Packages/com.unity.render-pipelines.high-definition@latest/index.html).
* Shader Graph tool - This tool allows you to create shaders using a visual node editor instead of writing code. For more information on the Shader Graph, see the [Shader Graph documentation](https://docs.unity3d.com/Packages/com.unity.shadergraph@latest/index.html).

*Note:* The High Definition Render Pipeline is currently in development, so consider it incomplete and subject to change (API, UX, scope). As such, it is not covered by regular Unity support. Unity is seeking feedback on the feature. To ask questions about the feature, visit the <a href="https://forum.unity.com/forums/graphics-experimental-previews.110/?_ga=2.9250101.1048197026.1528313382-1647295365.1509665782">Unity preview forum</a>.

## Template CI
CI has been added to the project and it will test your template on every commit on `Yamato`.
This will validate that the template package as well as embedded packages (if any) have the right structure, have tests and do not create console logs when opened with Unity.
The CI will also automatically test the template as it would be used by a user on multiple editor versions and OS.
You might need to tweak the list of editors and OS you want to test the template on. For more information, please [go here](https://confluence.hq.unity3d.com/pages/viewpage.action?spaceKey=PAK&title=Setting+up+your+package+CI)

`Note`: To make use of the CI, your repository must be added to Yamato.
Log in to [Yamato](https://yamato.cds.internal.unity3d.com/) and click on the Project + button on the top right.  This will open a dialog asking for you to specify a git url and project name.

## Trying out your template locally.

If you want to test your template locally from a user's perspective, you will need to make it available to a Unity Editor. This can be accomplished by following these steps:

1. Use upm-ci tools to test your template

    You need to make sure you have `Node.js` and `npm` _(install it from [here](https://nodejs.org/en/))_ installed on your machine to package successfully, as the script calls `npm` under the hood for packaging and publishing. The script is tested with `node@v10.16.0` and `npm@5.6.0`.
    Install globally the upm-ci package:

    ```npm install upm-ci-utils -g --registry https://api.bintray.com/npm/unity/unity-npm```

    1. **To run all your template tests**
        1. Open a console (or terminal) window and cd your way inside your template project folder

            ```upm-ci template test -u 2018.3```

            You can test against many versions of Unity with the -u parameter:

            - Testing on a specific version: use `-u 2019.1.0a13`
            - Testing on a latest release of a version: use `-u 2019.1`
            - Testing on the latest available trunk build: use `-u trunk`
            - Testing on a specific branch: use `-u team-name/my-branch`
            - Testing on a specific revision: use `-u 3de2277bb0e6`
            - Testing with an editor installed on your machine: use `-u /absolute/path/to/the/folder/containing/Unity.app/or/Unity.exe`

            By default, this will download the desired version of the editor in a .Editor folder created in the current working directory.

    1. **To test what a user would see**
        1. Open a console (or terminal) window and cd your way inside your template project folder

            ```upm-ci template pack```
            This will generate a folder /upm-ci~/templates/ containing a .tgz file of your converted template.

        1. Include the tarballed template package in Unity editor

            You can then copy the template's `tgz` package file in Unity in one of these paths to make it available in the editor when creating new projects:

            1. Mac: `<Unity Editor Root>/Contents/Resources/PackageManager/ProjectTemplates`

            1. Windows: `<Unity Editor Root>/Data/Resources/PackageManager/ProjectTemplates`

        1. Preview your project template

            Open Unity Hub. Locate the editor to which you added your template to.
            When creating a new project, you should see your template in the templates list:

            ![Template in new project](Packages/com.unity.template.mytemplate/Documentation~/images/template_in_new_project.png)

            Note: f you are launching the Unity editor without the hub, you will not see additional templates in the list.

## Publishing your template for use in the Editor

Currently, in trunk, we maintain the HD Template version in the last 6.0 LTS. 
This is then published and promoted as a package used for ALL 6.X versions.

1. Change versions and changelog like in this [PR](https://github.com/Unity-Technologies/Graphics/pull/8202) 
2. If you upgraded the project to a new Unity version, make sure to update dependencies in package.json and make them match in manifest.json of the project itself like in this [PR](https://github.com/Unity-Technologies/Graphics/pull/8212).
3. Launch Yamato job in the trunk: "Publish HDRP Template trunk (DRY RUN)"
4. Download the artifact zip and unzip it to find com.unity.template.hd-YOURVERSION.tgz
5. Test it locally, by adding it to Data\Resources\PackageManager\ProjectTemplate of your current editor and restart Unity Hub.
6. If everything goes well, you can launch the real job : "Publish HDRP Template trunk" (Warning : you can only do it once for each version) 
7. Create a workingset [PR](https://github.cds.internal.unity3d.com/unity/com.unity.working-set.templates/pull/444):  targeting one of the release/templates branch
8. If the tests do not pass, make sure you updated the pvp-exemptions file like [this](https://github.cds.internal.unity3d.com/unity/com.unity.working-set.templates/blob/7b35200cd55f2c1bc48930b2075b090459248f82/pvp-exemptions.json#L870)
9. When all the tests pass, add @unity/package-release-managers as reviewer
10. When the PR lands, the new template should be available in all the versions more or less instantly.

            Note: f you are launching the Unity editor without the hub, you will not see additional templates in the list.

## Publishing your template for use in the Editor

The first step to get your package published to production for public consumption is to send it to the candidates repository, where it can be evaluated by QA and Release Management.  You can publish your template to the candidates repository through the added CI, which is the **recommended** approach.

1. Once you are ready to publish a new version, say version `1.0.0`, you can add a git tag `rc-1.0.0` to the commit you want to publish. The CI will validate and then publish your template to `candidates`.

1. Request that your template package be published to production by [filling out the following form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSeEOeWszG7F5mx_VEYm8SrjcIajxa5WoLXh-yhLvw8odsEnaQ/viewform)

1. Once your template is published to production, the last step is to create the Ono PR to include your template with a Unity Release, and have it be discovered in the Hub. To do so, create a branch that includes your template in `External/PackageManager/Editor/editor_installer.json`

`Note`: You can retrieve a version of your template package as an artifact from CI pipelines following any commit made to your repository.  This will allow you to easily test a change at any point during your development.

    1. **To test what a user would see**
        1. Open a console (or terminal) window and cd your way inside your template project folder

            ```upm-ci template pack```
            This will generate a folder /upm-ci~/templates/ containing a .tgz file of your converted template.

        1. Include the tarballed template package in Unity editor

            You can then copy the template's `tgz` package file in Unity in one of these paths to make it available in the editor when creating new projects:

            1. Mac: `<Unity Editor Root>/Contents/Resources/PackageManager/ProjectTemplates`

            1. Windows: `<Unity Editor Root>/Data/Resources/PackageManager/ProjectTemplates`

        1. Preview your project template

            Open Unity Hub. Locate the editor to which you added your template to.
            When creating a new project, you should see your template in the templates list:

            ![Template in new project](Packages/com.unity.template.mytemplate/Documentation~/images/template_in_new_project.png)

            Note: f you are launching the Unity editor without the hub, you will not see additional templates in the list.

## Publishing your template for use in the Editor

The first step to get your package published to production for public consumption is to send it to the candidates repository, where it can be evaluated by QA and Release Management.  You can publish your template to the candidates repository through the added CI, which is the **recommended** approach.

1. Once you are ready to publish a new version, say version `1.0.0`, you can add a git tag `rc-1.0.0` to the commit you want to publish. The CI will validate and then publish your template to `candidates`.

1. Request that your template package be published to production by [filling out the following form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSeEOeWszG7F5mx_VEYm8SrjcIajxa5WoLXh-yhLvw8odsEnaQ/viewform)

1. Once your template is published to production, the last step is to create the Ono PR to include your template with a Unity Release, and have it be discovered in the Hub. To do so, create a branch that includes your template in `External/PackageManager/Editor/editor_installer.json`

`Note`: You can retrieve a version of your template package as an artifact from CI pipelines following any commit made to your repository.  This will allow you to easily test a change at any point during your development.

# About _Universal Render Pipeline Template_

The Universal Render Pipeline Template configures Project settings for Projects where performance, wide platform support, and ease of customizing graphics are the primary considerations.

This Template uses the following Unity features:

* Universal Render Pipeline (URP): a prebuilt Scriptable Render Pipeline that is quick and easy to customize, and lets you create optimized graphics across a wide range of platforms. URP also includes an optimized 2D renderer complete with 2D lights and pixel perfect rendering, and an integrated post-processing solution. For more information on URP, see the [URP documentation](https://docs.unity3d.com/Packages/com.unity.render-pipelines.universal@latest).
* Shader Graph: a tool that allows you to create shaders using a visual node editor instead of writing code. For more information on Shader Graph, see the [Shader Graph documentation](https://docs.unity3d.com/Packages/com.unity.shadergraph@latest).

The template contains the following:

* A sample Scene that contains examples of how to configure lighting settings, Materials, Shaders, and post-processing effects in URP
* Several preconfigured [Universal Render Pipline Assets](https://docs.unity3d.com/Packages/com.unity.render-pipelines.universal@latest/index.html?subfolder=/manual/universalrp-asset.html) that let you quickly swap between graphics quality levels
* [Presets](https://docs.unity3d.com/Manual/Presets.html) that have been optimized for use with URP

## Template CI
CI has been added to the project and it will test your template on every commit on `Yamato`.
This will validate that the template package as well as embedded packages (if any) have the right structure, have tests and do not create console logs when opened with Unity.
The CI will also automatically test the template as it would be used by a user on multiple editor versions and OS.
You might need to tweak the list of editors and OS you want to test the template on. For more information, please [go here](https://confluence.hq.unity3d.com/pages/viewpage.action?spaceKey=PAK&title=Setting+up+your+package+CI)

`Note`: To make use of the CI, your repository must be added to Yamato.
Log in to [Yamato](https://yamato.cds.internal.unity3d.com/) and click on the Project + button on the top right.  This will open a dialog asking for you to specify a git url and project name.

## Trying out your template locally.

If you want to test your template locally from a user's perspective, you will need to make it available to a Unity Editor. This can be accomplished by following these steps:

1. Use upm-ci tools to test your template

    You need to make sure you have `Node.js` and `npm` _(install it from [here](https://nodejs.org/en/))_ installed on your machine to package successfully, as the script calls `npm` under the hood for packaging and publishing. The script is tested with `node@v10.16.0` and `npm@5.6.0`.
    Install globally the upm-ci package:

    ```npm install upm-ci-utils -g --registry https://api.bintray.com/npm/unity/unity-npm```

    1. **To run all your template tests**
        1. Open a console (or terminal) window and cd your way inside your template project folder

            ```upm-ci template test -u 2018.3```

            You can test against many versions of Unity with the -u parameter:

            - Testing on a specific version: use `-u 2019.1.0a13`
            - Testing on a latest release of a version: use `-u 2019.1`
            - Testing on the latest available trunk build: use `-u trunk`
            - Testing on a specific branch: use `-u team-name/my-branch`
            - Testing on a specific revision: use `-u 3de2277bb0e6`
            - Testing with an editor installed on your machine: use `-u /absolute/path/to/the/folder/containing/Unity.app/or/Unity.exe`

            By default, this will download the desired version of the editor in a .Editor folder created in the current working directory.

    1. **To test what a user would see**
        1. Open a console (or terminal) window and cd your way inside your template project folder

            ```upm-ci template pack```
            This will generate a folder /upm-ci~/templates/ containing a .tgz file of your converted template.

        1. Include the tarballed template package in Unity editor

            You can then copy the template's `tgz` package file in Unity in one of these paths to make it available in the editor when creating new projects:

            1. Mac: `<Unity Editor Root>/Contents/Resources/PackageManager/ProjectTemplates`

            1. Windows: `<Unity Editor Root>/Data/Resources/PackageManager/ProjectTemplates`

        1. Preview your project template

            Open Unity Hub. Locate the editor to which you added your template to.
            When creating a new project, you should see your template in the templates list:

            ![Template in new project](Packages/com.unity.template.mytemplate/Documentation~/images/template_in_new_project.png)

            Note: f you are launching the Unity editor without the hub, you will not see additional templates in the list.

# XR Graphics Testing Library

The purpose of this package is to share code between the various test projects and facilitate the use of MockHMD for image comparison tests.


--- Tests/SRPTests/Projects/HDRP_Tests/Assets/GraphicTests/Scenes/8x_ShaderGraph/ReadMe.txt ---
Test starting with 81__ are HDRP_ShaderGraph_TestScene(s), which means that it will make two image comparisons. One of Shader Graph objects, one of HDRP/Lit objects that the Shader Graph objects match. The reason is to ensure parity between SG & HDRP.

In these scenes, you can switch between Shader Graph & HDRP/Lit comparison objects to see the difference faster. To do so start the 81__ scene, and press any key. You will then be able to move the camera around with the mouse and cycle between Shader Graph and HDRP material objects using space.
Additional controls are:
z = start/stop directional light rotate
x = enable/disable camera rotation

8101_Opaque is a condensed scene, it will test for:

- All Surface Types
	> Standard
	> Specular Color
	> Iridescence
	> Subsurface Scattering
	> Translucent
	> Anistropy
- Decals
- Double Sided
- Geometric Specular AA

8102_Transparent is a condensed scene, it will test for:

- Blend Modes
- Fog
- Refraction
- Back Then Front Rendering
- Distortion (Temporarily broken / removed)

--- Tests/SRPTests/Projects/HDRP_Tests/Assets/GraphicTests/Scenes/1x_Materials/1218_Lit_DiffusionProfiles/README.md ---
# Cases tested in this scene:

* One camera watching diffusion profiles (referenced inside the HDRP asset)
* One camera inside a volume with a diffusion profile volume override using a list of profile that are not inside the HDRP asset
* One object using layered lit with transmission referencing diffusion profile in the material UI
* One shader graph hair shader with transmission referencing diffusion profile in the shader graph material UI
* One shader graph fabric with transmission referencing a diffusion profile saved inside the shader graph diffusion profile slot
* One shader graph stacklit with transmission referencing a diffusion profile saved inside a shader graph diffusion profile node
* One shader graph lit with a checkerboard pattern to choose the diffusion profile referencing diffusion profile saved inside two nodes.
* One lit shader without diffusion profile but transmission enabled (it uses the default diffusion profile)


--- Tests/SRPTests/Projects/HDRP_Tests/Assets/GraphicTests/Scenes/9x_Other/9006_StencilUsage/Readme.txt ---
This test have been specically written to test stencil usage with RenderDoc.

Do a renderdoc capture and compare the image with what is inside this folder. It must match. Sadly stencil usage is very hard to detect
and you can miss a bit easily, thus why it is like this.
