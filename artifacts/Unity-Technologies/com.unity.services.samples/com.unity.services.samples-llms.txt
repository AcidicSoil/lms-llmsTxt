# Com.Unity.Services.Samples

> The purpose of this repository is to provide developers with practical, working examples that showcase how Unity Gaming Services can be integrated into Unity projects. It aims to simplify backend game development by demonstrating real-world use cases such as player authentication, in-game economies, seasonal content management, and real-time communication via lobbies and relay systems. The samples are meant to accelerate development by showing how multiple services can be combined for optimal performance and scalability.
