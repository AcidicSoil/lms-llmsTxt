## [1.2.0] - 2023-02-16

### Dynamic Addressables Network Prefabs Sample

Added the Dynamic Addressables Network Prefabs Sample. This sample showcases the available use-cases for the dynamic prefab system, which allows us to add new spawnable prefabs at runtime. This would be useful for games trying to use both [Addressables](https://docs.unity3d.com/Packages/com.unity.addressables@0.8/manual/index.html) and Netcode for GameObjects (#63) (#94) (#96) (#97) (#98) (#99) (#100) (#101) (#103)

### 2DSpaceShooter

#### Fixed
- Resolved issue where the colour of powerups was not displayed correctly (#91)
- Removing warning when spawning powerups (#90). Fixed the order in which powerups were spawned and when their NetworkVariable value was initialized. Now they are spawned beforehand.
- Fixing bullet explosion desync (#89). Bullet explosion vfx were happening too early on clients because of NetworkTransform's interpolation. Bullets are now no longer synchronised by NetworkTransforms and instead only have their velocity set through client rpcs when they are spawned. Since they are no longer interpolated, they are not lagging behind the server and are at the correct position when they receive the despawn message from the server.
- Fix: Broken Reference for Underline Character in Font Asset (#87)

#### Changed
- Upgraded sample to 2021.3.18f1 LTS (#91)
- Readme was updated (#96)
- Added readme banner image (#101)

### Invaders

#### Changed
- Upgraded sample to 2021.3.18f1 LTS (#91)
- Readme was updated (#96)
- Added readme banner image (#101)

### Bitesize Samples Repository
#### Changed
- Readme was updated (#96)

- ThirdPersonController starter assets added (#62)
- Uniformize gitignore files (#65)
- Art Pass (#68)
- Anti Aliasing (#72)
- Third Person Character Controller integration with custom IP UI (#66) The sample has been refactored to feature a PlayerPrefab inside NetworkManager that is a networked variant of a prefab from [Unity's Starter Assets](https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/essentials/starter-assets-third-person-character-controller-196526). Other improvements include:
  - Input polling via the new Input System

## [1.0.0] - 2021-10-20

### Client Driven

A new sample was added named client driven. It focus on client driven movements, networked physics, spawning vs statically placed objects, object reparenting

### Invaders

#### Changed
- Updated to Netcode for GameObjects 1.0.0.
- Player now use ClientNetworkTransform for client driven movement
- Network Manager now uses Unity Transport instead of UNet
- SceneTransitionHandler : now uses the new Scene Manager and Scene Loading events
- InvadersGame : replicated time remaining now uses a RPC instead of a one time synchonized NetworkVariable

#### Fixed
- Network behaviour in OnDestroy was moved to OnNetworkDespawn

### 2DSpaceShooter

#### Changed
- Updated to Netcode for GameObjects 1.0.0.
- Player name is no longer static but based on the client id.

## [0.2.0] - 2021-07-21

### Invaders

#### New Changes

- Game - rename all our alien prefabs to have a more generic name, the same principle was applied to our codebase, renamed variables/fields/classes to something more generic
- Game: Fix a crash in shipping build
- Enemies: Rename our main enemy class to EnemyAgent + minor clean-ups + implement a grace shoot timer period
- InvadersGame: Some big refactories here, the UpdateEnemies function not outputs a set of flags (bitmask) rather than having separated booleans to keep track off
- InvadersGame: Fix an edge case of the game loop where if the enemies would reach the bottom they would never respawn, now when they do reach that bottom boundary it will be game over
- InvadersGame: Introduce additional game over reasons
- LobbyControl: Introduce a minimum player count variable that could be tweaked in the inspector so that the users can start playing in the editor with just the host in the lobby
- PlayerControl: Unified the NotifyGameOver function with the InvadersGame one + added different texts for all the possible game over reasons to be displayed
- PlayerControl: Fix a minor issue where the Player graphics are not hidden on all connected instances upon "death".

#### Known Issues

- Upon import a MissingReferenceException is triggered from within MLAPI: **"MissingReferenceException: The object of type ‘GameObject' has been destroyed but you are still trying to access it.
  Your script should either check if it is null or you should not destroy the object."** in:
  - UnityEngine.GameObject.GetComponent[T] () (at /Users/bokken/buildslave/unity/build/Runtime/Export/Scripting/GameObject.bindings.cs:28)

### 2DSpaceShooter

#### New Changes
- Cleaned up project structure, removed duplicate art assets and moved remaining asset into sub folders.
- Removed empty MonoBehaviours which were used as tags and using the Unity tag system instead.
- Removed the dependency to the community contributions repository and copied `NetworkManagerHud` and `NetworkObjectPool` into the sample.
- Small QoL improvements to scripting. Using `TryGetComponent` and `CompareTag`.
- Fix audio issues by moving the audio listener onto the player ship object.

#### Known Issues

- Missing Reference Exception thrown when leaving playmode, can be ignored:<br>
*MissingReferenceException: The object of type 'NetworkObjectPool' has been destroyed but you are still trying to access it.
Your script should either check if it is null or you should not destroy the object.
MLAPI.Extensions.NetworkObjectPool.ReturnNetworkObject*

[![NetcodeVersion](https://img.shields.io/badge/Netcode%20Version:-2.0.0+-57b9d3.svg?logo=unity&color=2196F3)](https://github.com/Unity-Technologies/com.unity.netcode.gameobjects/releases/tag/ngo%2F2.0.0)*
[![LatestRelease](https://img.shields.io/badge/Latest%20%20Github%20Release:-v1.10.0-57b9d3.svg?logo=github&color=brightgreen)](https://github.com/Unity-Technologies/com.unity.multiplayer.samples.bitesize/releases/tag/v1.10.0)
<br><br>

*: Due to a regression in Netcode for GameObjects pertaining to the destruction of NetworkObjects when a client unsuccessfully connects, the Dynamic Addressables Network Prefabs sample has remained at v1.7.1. It will be upgraded in the near future with the latest Netcode version including a fix for the regression.

This repository contains a collection of bitesize sample projects and games that showcase different techniques
which can help you get started with development of a multiplayer 
project using [Netcode for GameObjects](https://github.com/Unity-Technologies/com.unity.netcode.gameobjects).
<br><br>

# Bitesize Samples Overview

### 2D Space Shooter Overview

The [2D Space Shooter Sample](https://github.com/Unity-Technologies/com.unity.multiplayer.samples.bitesize/tree/main/Basic/2DSpaceShooter) was a UNET sample that has been converted over to NGO. Check it out to learn more about physics movement and status effects using Netcode `NetworkVariables` and `ObjectPooling`.
<br><br>

### Distributed Authority Social Hub

[Social Hub](https://github.com/Unity-Technologies/com.unity.multiplayer.samples.bitesize/tree/main/Basic/DistributedAuthoritySocialHub) is built with the Distributed Authority topology, showcasing recommended approaches to designing gameplay features with the new framework inside Netcode for GameObjects v2.0 in tandem with the Multiplayer SDK. This sample serves as the educational entry point for users who are looking to implement a similar networking topology inside their projects.
<br><br>

### Multiplayer Use Cases Overview

The [Multiplayer Use Cases sample](https://github.com/Unity-Technologies/com.unity.multiplayer.samples.bitesize/tree/main/Basic/MultiplayerUseCases) show you how to perform common actions in a multiplayer environment, so that you can build the features of your game with them in mind.

In this sample you'll learn about the core features of Netcode For GameObjects (Netcode) through practical examples that you'll be able to extend and adapt to fit the gameplay logic of your own game. 

Each scene comes with an in-editor tutorial that will help you explore the main scripts and object of each scene, so you know where to look at to find what you're looking for.
<br><br>

### Client Driven Overview
See the [Client Driven Sample](https://github.com/Unity-Technologies/com.unity.multiplayer.samples.bitesize/tree/main/Basic/ClientDriven) to learn about client driven movements, networked physics, spawning vs in-scene placed `NetworkObjects`, and `NetworkObject` parenting.
<br><br>

### Dynamic Addressables Network Prefabs Overview

Check out the [Dynamic Addressables Network Prefabs Sample](https://github.com/Unity-Technologies/com.unity.multiplayer.samples.bitesize/tree/main/Basic/DynamicAddressablesNetworkPrefabs) to learn more about the dynamic prefab system, which allows us to add new spawnable network prefabs at runtime.

# Distributed Authority Social Hub Sample
<br>

[![UnityVersion](https://img.shields.io/badge/Unity%20Version:-6000.0.24%20LTS-57b9d3.svg?logo=unity&color=2196F3)](https://unity.com/releases/editor/whats-new/6000.0.24)
[![NetcodeVersion](https://img.shields.io/badge/Netcode%20Version:-2.1.1-57b9d3.svg?logo=unity&color=2196F3)](https://docs-multiplayer.unity3d.com/netcode/2.1.1/about)
<br><br>

Social Hub is a beginner-friendly sample project aimed to demonstrate Distributed Authority's core features and benefits, helping users seamlessly integrate Distributed Authority into their own game projects.

Distributed Authority, a networking topology offered by Netcode for GameObjects v2+, is a flexible authority model and an out-of-the-box backend solution, targeting developers who require scalable, performant, and cost-effective networking options.

<br>

# Social Hub Overview

Within Social Hub, you are free to explore Distributed Authority's key features & functionalities in a sandbox-like environment. Such features include: 
* Automatic redistribution of ownership of NetworkObjects across connected clients
* Client-side NetworkObject spawning and deferred NetworkObject despawning
* Ownership transfer of NetworkObjects with variable ownership flags
* Host migration of a networked game session

<br>

## Requirements

Social Hub is compatible with the latest Unity Long Term Support (LTS) editor version, currently [6000.0 LTS](https://unity.com/releases/unity-6). Please include standalone support for Windows/Mac in your installation.

Social Hub has been developed and tested on the following platforms:
- Windows
- Mac
- Android (Pixel 6)
- iOS (iPhone 13)

<br>

## Opening the project for the First Time

Once you have downloaded the project, follow the steps below to get up and running:
- Check that you have installed the most recent [LTS editor version](https://unity.com/releases/editor/archive).
  - Include standalone support for Windows/Mac in your installation. 
- Add the project to the _Unity Hub_ by clicking on the **Add** button and pointing it to the root folder of the downloaded project.
- Hit the **Play** button. You can then host a new game or join an existing one using the in-game UI.

<br>

## Exploring the project

Social Hub is an 64-player sandbox-style multiplayer experience where players can interact and collaborate within a simulated world. The control model is WASD controls, with the E button mapped as the key to interact with crates and pots. These NetworkObjects can be picked up and subsequently dropped or tossed, showcasing how to attach one NetworkObject to another with an animated rig through the use of FixedJoints. As a NetworkObject is picked up by a client, authority of that NetworkObject is transferred to that client.

A client has authority over its player NetworkObject, thus the movement, animations, and interactions performed by a client are client-authoritative. 

Code is organized in domain-based assemblies.

<br>

### Registering the project with Unity Gaming Services (UGS)

Social Hub leverages several services from UGS to facilitate connectivity between players. To use these services inside your project, you must [create an organization](https://support.unity.com/hc/en-us/articles/208592876-How-do-I-create-a-new-Organization-) inside the Unity Dashboard. Consult the Multiplayer SDK [Getting Started](https://docs.unity.com/ugs/en-us/manual/mps-sdk/manual/get-started) manual for more resources.

<br>

## Testing multiplayer

In order to see the multiplayer functionality in action, launch multiple instances of the game locally on your computer, using either Multiplayer Play Mode or standalone builds, and connect using the same session name. Friends can join along too, so long as they join via the Main Menu with the same session name. See [how to test](https://docs-multiplayer.unity3d.com/netcode/current/tutorials/testing/testing_locally) for more info.

# Dynamic Addressables Network Prefabs Sample

[![UnityVersion](https://img.shields.io/badge/Unity%20Version:-2022.3%20LTS-57b9d3.svg?logo=unity&color=2196F3)](https://unity.com/releases/editor/whats-new/2022.3.0)

[![LatestRelease](https://img.shields.io/badge/Latest%20%20Github%20Release:-v1.6.0-57b9d3.svg?logo=github&color=brightgreen)](https://github.com/Unity-Technologies/com.unity.multiplayer.samples.bitesize/releases/tag/v1.6.0)
<br><br>

*: Due to a regression in Netcode for GameObjects pertaining to the destruction of NetworkObjects when a client unsuccessfully connects, this sample has remained at v1.7.1. It will be upgraded in the near future with the latest Netcode version including a fix for the regression.

The Dynamic Prefabs Sample showcases the available use-cases for the dynamic prefab system, which allows us to add new spawnable prefabs at runtime. This sample uses Addressables to load the dynamic prefab, however any GameObject with a NetworkObject component can be used, regardless of its source. This sample also uses in-game UI (created using UI Toolkit) to interface with the dynamic prefabs system with configurable options like artificial latency and network spawn timeout for easy testing.

## Note on Addressables
Addressables are great for managing your memory, download times, adding DLCs.

Memory management with Addressables is great on platforms with restricted memory. Think mobile or webgl. In general on mobile, you won't load prefabs in memory directly on scene load, you'll want to load them only when you actually need them. You could load them from disk or from a CDN, that doesn't matter.
Another use case is for reducing the initial app download time. You could ship a slim app with only the essentials asset wise. And when your player is in menus or playing the tutorial, start downloading the remainder of the app through addressables.

There's a lot of optimizations potentials around asset bundles and addressables, we highly encourage you to look through them, they can be used on pretty much any platforms.

## Exploring the Sample

Each scene in the project showcases a different, isolated feature of the API, allowing for easy extraction into other projects. We suggest exploring them in order to get a good understanding of the flow of dynamically loading and spawning network prefabs. The use-cases available in this sample are based around the current known limitations.

**Important:** This sample assumes that Addressables will never fail to load, therefore the server does not account for the case in which a client fails to load an Addressable. In a realistic implementation, you would want to either have the offending client try to load the Addressable again, or disconnect it from the session. 
<br><br>

### Each Scene:

- Scene 00_Preloading Dynamic Prefabs
  - This is the simplest case of a dynamic prefab - we instruct all game instances to load a network prefab (it can be just one, it could also be a set of network prefabs) and inject them to NetworkManager's NetworkPrefabs list before starting the server.
  
  - This is the less intrusive option for your development, as you don't have any additional spawning and addressable management to do later in your game. 
  <br><br>

- Scene 01_Connection Approval Required For Late Joining
  - An optional use-case scenario that walks through what a server would need to validate from a connecting client when dynamically loading network prefabs. Other use-cases don't allow for reconciliation after the server has loaded a prefab dynamically and before a client joined, whereas this one enables this functionality. 
  
  - This is to support late join and should be used in combination with the other techniques described below.
  <br><br>

- Scene 02_Server Authoritative Preload All Prefabs Asynchronously
  - A simple use-case where the server notifies all clients to preload a collection of network prefabs. The server will not invoke a spawn directly after the addressable loading in this use-case, and will incrementally load each dynamic prefab, one prefab at a time.
  
  - This acts as a "warning" notification to clients that they'll soon need this prefab. This allows being less intrusive in the spawning process later as we can assume all clients have loaded the prefab already.
  
  - This is different from option 0, as here this is done when clients are connected and already in game. This allows for more flexibility around your gameplay and could load different prefabs depending on where your players are at in the game for example.
  <br><br>

- Scene 03_Server Authoritative Try Spawn Synchronously
  - This is the first technique that loads and spawns sequentially. This is a dynamic prefab loading use-case where the server instructs all clients to load a single network prefab, and will only invoke a spawn once all clients have successfully completed their respective loads of said prefab. The server will initially send a ClientRpc to all clients, begin loading the prefab on the server, will await acknowledgement of a load via ServerRpcs from each client, and will only Spawn() the instantiated prefab over the network once it has received an acknowledgement from every client, within `m_SynchronousSpawnTimeoutTimer` seconds.

  - This and the next technique allow for the most flexibility compared to the previous ones.

  - This technique makes sure all clients have loaded a prefab before spawning and starting gameplay on that prefab. This is useful for game changing objects, like a big boss that could kill everyone. In that case you want to make sure all clients have loaded that prefab before spawning that object. 
  <br><br>

- Scene 04_Server Authoritative Spawn Dynamic Prefab Using Network Visibility
  - A dynamic prefab loading use-case where the server instructs all clients to load a single network prefab via a ClientRpc, will spawn said prefab as soon as it is loaded on the server, and will mark it as network-visible only to clients that have already loaded that same prefab. As soon as a client loads the prefab locally, it sends an acknowledgement ServerRpc, and the server will mark that spawned NetworkObject as network-visible to that client.

  - This makes sure that no client can block the spawn of certain objects by making it visible as soon as specific clients have loaded that prefab. This is great for network reactivity, but might create inconsistent world views for each client depending on whether you've loaded that prefab or not. Using that technique for boss loading could create a situation where your player sees its health decreasing rapidly for no visible reason because the boss is loaded server side and hitting you, but you haven't loaded it yet and it's invisible on your client.
  <br><br>

- Scene 05_API Playground Showcasing All Post-Connection Use-Cases
  This scene serves as an API playground to test how all of the use-cases can work in tandem.
<br><br><br>

## Known Limitations
- If you have NetworkConfig.ForceSamePrefabs enabled, you can only modify your prefab lists **before** starting
  networking, and the server and all connected clients must all have the same exact set of prefabs
  added via this method before connecting.

- Adding a prefab on the server **does not** automatically add it on the client - it's up to you
  to make sure the client and server are synchronized via whatever method makes sense for your game
  (RPCs, configs, deterministic loading, etc). This sample lists some of those possible methods with basic implementations you can adapt to your various use cases.

- If the server sends a Spawn message to a client that does not yet have the corresponding prefab loaded, the spawn message
  (and any other relevant messages) will be held for a configurable time before an error is logged (default 1 second, configured via
  NetworkConfig.SpawnTimeout). This is intented to enable the SDK to gracefully
  handle unexpected conditions that slow down asset loading (slow disks, slow network, etc). This timeout
  should not be relied upon and code shouldn't be written around it - your code should be written so that
  the asset is expected to be loaded before it's needed.

## Future Improvement Ideas
This section describes some next steps a game developer could do to extend the sample code available here. This logic is left to the reader, this sample focuses on dynamic prefab management.
<br><br>
- Adding more advanced logic that would kick players that are consistently failing to load required Addressables.

- Compress Addressable GUID list before it is sent, thus reducing the amount of data being exchanged.

- Rather than exchanging Addressable GUIDS (underlying type `FixedString128Bytes`), the server and clients could instead exchange just a `short` index that would refer to an Addressable stored in some sort of list (potentially in a `ScriptableObject`). This would drastically reduce the amount of data being exchanged over the network. 

- This sample does not cover the use-case of using Addressables to load in custom User Generated Content (UGC) and replicating that to other clients.

<br><br>

This sample provides a series of scenes. Each scene explains a specific API or system commonly used in Netcode for GameObjects. In this sample you will learn more about client-server communication, state synchronization, and other typical mechanics of multiplayer games.
<br><br>

## Sample overview

Making a multiplayer game is different than making a singleplayer one. 

Understanding how to send data and events over the network and to the right players is a challenge.

Multiplayer Use Cases' goal is to show you how to perform common actions in a multiplayer environment, so that you can build the features of your game with them in mind.

In this sample you'll learn about the core features of Netcode For GameObjects (Netcode) through practical examples that you'll be able to extend and adapt to fit the gameplay logic of your own game. 

Each scene comes with an in-editor tutorial that will help you explore the main scripts and object of each scene, so you know where to look at to find what you're looking for.

# ‼️Experimental Samples‼️

Experimental samples are new samples or experimental modifications made to mature samples. Unity does not support Experimental samples because they are in the early stages of development, address currently unsupported use cases, or rely on experimental technologies.

Experimental samples can go through many changes before they are ready to be released and labelled as _Production-Ready_. They might pass the verification requirements; however, they could be deprecated. There is no guarantee for future support, so you should not use experimental samples in production.

## Goal and Purpose

The goal of this folder is to aggregate ideas and small projects in development to accelerate community access. They are made available to foster discussion and gauge interest in particular areas. 

**These samples come with no quality guarantee and are _not_ recommended for production use.**

This means:
- They are unsupported and may be changed or removed at any time. 
- They are not rigorously tested against Unity Editor versions, platforms, or devices.
- They are not maintained to the same quality or standards as those labelled as _Production-Ready_.
- They may address unsupported use cases.

For education on game features critical to your production, please use our **Production-Ready** [Bitesize samples](https://docs-multiplayer.unity3d.com/netcode/current/learn/bitesize/bitesize-introduction/), [Boss Room](https://docs-multiplayer.unity3d.com/netcode/current/learn/bossroom/bossroom/), and [documentation](https://docs-multiplayer.unity3d.com/).

# Getting Started
This project is built to demonstrate Netcode for GameObjects (NGO) running in distributed authority mode. 

## There are several distributed authority NGO mode demos:
- **Asteroids:** A more "full feature" usage example of distributed authority.
- **Parenting:** A parenting example in ditributed authority where everything is owner authoritative.
- **Ownership:** Demonstrates various ownership permissions along with how "showing" and "hiding" objects works.
- **Deferred Despawn:** A simpler sub-set from the Asteroids demo assets to demonstrate the deferred despawn feature.
- **Scene Loading:** Demonstrates how NGO's integrated scene management works in distributed authority mode and how session owners control scene events.
- **Stress Test:** A very simple spawning scale stress test.

## Running Demos
**Required Editor: Unity 6 (6000.0)**
After cloning the repository, add the project to your Unity Hub and open it like any other project. Make a stand alone build and run.

### Connect Mode Options:
When you start any of the demos/samples you will always be presented with a "Mode" button in the top left corner and a "Main Menu" button in the top right corner. If you click the "Main Menu" button it will take you back to the demo scene selection screen. If you click the "Mode" button then you will be presented with several options of what mode you want to test:

![image](https://media.github.cds.internal.unity3d.com/user/3057/files/87fd2ec4-bdb6-435f-ba72-b6300d367e5b)

- **DAHost:** Primarily used for development. This mode will provide you with the option to start a "DAHost" (a host that mocks the cloud state service) or a "DAClient" (a standard client that runs in distributed authority session mode). 
- **DAHostRelay:** Primarily used for development and network performance comparison. This acts just like the DAHost mode with the option to connect to a relay service. This provides a reasonable context when comparing network performance relative to when connected to a live service (the UGS backend cloud state service for distributed authority sessions).
- **ServiceLocal:** Primarily for development when testing a locally running service (contact @noel.stephens if you are interested in setting this up).
- **ServiceLive:** Connect to or start a cloud state service network session. This will provide you with a session name text field and a connect button. If you want to start a new session, enter in the name of the session and hit "connect". If you want to join an existing session perform the same steps (enter the session name to connect to and click "connect").

# Project Overview
The most complex full featured testing grounds/sandbox scene is the `Asteroids` scene asset located in the Assets\Scenes folder:

<img width="416" alt="Screenshot 2024-07-11 at 16 04 49" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/6041b766-b540-46fc-a823-d74eeab7442d">

## Bootstrap scene
Most of the time the `Asteroids` scene is the best way to test all of the POC feature functionality. However, there are other scenes that are used for testing purposes (or you might want to create your own for a new feature or to simplify testing). The `BootStrap` scene's camera contains the `BootstrapHandler` component that defines what scenes are presented in the initial first screen GUI when running a stand alone build (and the `BootStrap` scene is still in the index 0 slot of the scenes in build list):

<img width="731" alt="Screenshot 2024-07-11 at 16 16 33" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/4d5515c4-c38f-4209-9a83-90325e4a7a29">

## Test Scenes and Scripts
The test scenes are located in the Assets\Scenes\Tests folder along with test specific scripts in the Assets\Scenes\Tests\Scripts. If you want to create a test scene to validate a specific new feature (or the like), then this would be the area to add it. It might be easier to move the `BootstrapScene` the 0 index of the scenes in build list and add your newly created test scene to that (for rapid access/development if you are using stand alone builds).

## Asteroids Scene
For the most part, the content is developed like a standard NGO enabled game. Due to some of the differences in distributed authority vs cient-server NGO operation modes, there are a few things to take into consideration/be aware of:

### Object Pools:
In order to obtain the most performant response time in spawning objects (especially with things like POC interest management), almost everything that can be spawned has an associated object pool. Each pool system contains an `ObjectPoolSystem` component that is derived from a `MonoBehaviour` and implements the `INetworkPrefabInstanceHandler` interface. Pool systems only require that an existing `NetworkManager` instance be available in order to function properly. `ObjectPoolSystem` also provides you with the ability to persist the pool between network sessions (i.e. hitting the `X` and reloading the `Asteroids` scene) in order to reduce development iteration time when using large pools that can take awhile to instantiate. Check the `DontDestroyOnSceneUnload` property to enable this on a per `ObjectPoolSystem` basis.

<img width="728" alt="Screenshot 2024-07-11 at 16 18 07" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/6bf6929a-d30f-4c06-a8ff-66b511489dda">

You can easily create additional pools by duplicating an existing prefab, renaming it, changing its assigned netowrk prefab to pool, and updating how many instances the pool should start with. The `ObjectPoolSystem` component will dynamically increase its pool size if the demand goes beyond the initial pool size settings.

### Ship Controls:
The ship controls are as follows:

**WASD or Arrow Keys:** Activates ship thrusters. Momentum is gained over time.

<img width="426" alt="Screenshot 2024-07-11 at 16 26 30" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/f86db077-7026-4316-b463-b461ea8e872d">

**Space Bar:** Fires lasers.

<img width="434" alt="Screenshot 2024-07-11 at 16 28 33" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/37311c24-9d08-446c-a650-3142806568c1">

**{G}rab-Tractor:** The `(G)` key activates the tractor beam that lets a ship grap a mine. This feature was added to demonstrate the client-driven ownership transfer. If a mine is not owned by the client grabbing it, then the client will claim ownership over the mine as it pulls it in to be locked into place.

<img width="421" alt="Screenshot 2024-07-11 at 16 32 19" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/e936ef8b-cf6d-415f-bed3-9c96949ac958">

### Display toggles

**{O}wnership Overlay:** The `(O)` key toggles ownership overlays on all objects. The color corresponds to the owning client for each object.

<img width="911" alt="Screenshot 2024-07-11 at 16 35 47" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/8b68b92a-3221-47e6-bc98-36db44221e6b">

**Runtime {N}etwork Stats Monitor:** The `(N)` or `(TAB)` key toggles the RNSM tool.

**{M}ap Interest HUD:** The `(M)` key activates an interest heads up display that will pop up in the bottom right corner of the render view. 
Hitting `(M)` once enables the transparent background view:

<img width="789" alt="Screenshot 2024-07-11 at 16 41 46" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/331e7bbf-72dd-4402-bb53-46485e0127ad">

Hitting `(M)` a second time disables the view.

**{ [ } & { ] } Zoom Keys:** The `([)` key zooms in and the `(])` key zooms out when the overlay interest map is enabled.

<img width="779" alt="Screenshot 2024-07-11 at 16 44 18" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/7f2ae57d-5356-46b9-8706-64e05889f5f4">

**{`~`} Runtime Console Log:** Hitting the back quote/`(~)` key  will toggle the runtime log output for the console log.

# Dedicated Game Server

[![UnityVersion](https://img.shields.io/badge/Unity%20Version:-6000.0.3f1%20-57b9d3.svg?logo=unity&color=2196F3)](https://unity.com/releases/editor/whats-new/6000.0.3)
[![NetcodeVersion](https://img.shields.io/badge/Netcode%20Version:-1.9.1-57b9d3.svg?logo=unity&color=2196F3)](https://docs-multiplayer.unity3d.com/netcode/current/about)
<br><br>

The Dedicated Game Server sample project uses Netcode For GameObjects (NGO). It also demonstrates the structure of a project that uses the dedicated server and the tools that you can use to configure it.
<br><br>

# Sample Overview

The dedicated server sample scene contains a small maze with interactive doors and patrolling AI characters. Player characters can move around and open or close the doors using the switches nearby. You can use this sample scene to learn how to do the following:

- Integrate features from the [Dedicated Server](https://docs.unity3d.com/Packages/com.unity.dedicated-server@1.0/manual/index.html) and [Multiplayer Play Mode](https://docs.unity3d.com/Packages/com.unity.multiplayer.playmode@1.0/manual/index.html) packages with Netcode for GameObjects to with the dedicated server architecture.
* [Set default comand line arguments](https://docs.unity3d.com/Packages/com.unity.dedicated-server@1.0/manual/cli-arguments.html)
* Use [multiplayer roles](https://docs.unity3d.com/Packages/com.unity.dedicated-server@1.0/manual/multiplayer-roles.html).
* Use the dedicated server with [multiplayer play mode](https://docs-multiplayer.unity3d.com/mppm/current/about/).
* Strip GameObjects from the clients and server.
- Integrate a project that uses the dedicated server with the [Game Server Hosting](https://docs.unity.com/ugs/en-us/manual/game-server-hosting/manual/welcome) and [Matchmaker](https://docs.unity.com/ugs/en-us/manual/matchmaker/manual/matchmaker-overview) services.
<br><br>

## Exploring the Sample

The dedicated server sample has a different workflows when you select the Client or Server multiplayer role. Both servers and clients start at the StartupScene, where Unity initializes the relevant systems. 

### The server multiplayer role
Unity moves the server to the game scene, where it waits for clients to connect. 

### The client multiplayer role
Unity moves clients to the Metagame scene. From here you can use the main menu to connect to a server. Select the **Find Match** to join a matchmaking queue to connect to a server. Select **Join with Direct IP** to connect to a server directly when you know its IP address. In both cases Unity moves clients to the game scene when the client connects.

#### Autoconnect mode
Use the autoconnect mode to automatically connect as a client to a local server without moving to the Metagame scene. You can use this mode to speed up testing.

To enable autoconnect mode on the main editor, do the following:

1. Set the editor [multiplayer role](https://docs.unity3d.com/Packages/com.unity.dedicated-server@1.0/manual/multiplayer-roles.html) to **Client**.
2. Open the StartupScene
3. In the Hierarchy window, select the **ApplicationEntryPoint** GameObject.
4. In the **ApplicationEntryPoint** component, select the **Autoconnect if client** checkbox .

## Set up the dedicated game server sample

### Register the project with Unity Gaming Services (UGS)

This sample uses the following services from Unity Game Services (UGS) to help connect between players: 

- Game Server Hosting
- Matchmaker
 
To use these services inside your project, [create an organization](https://support.unity.com/hc/en-us/articles/208592876-How-do-I-create-a-new-Organization-) inside the Unity Dashboard. 

#### Set up the Game Server Hosting service

To set up the Game Server Hosting (Multiplay) service, do the following: 
1. [Test the dedicated server sample in a build](#test-dedicated-server-sample). 
2. Generate the build that Unity uploads to the Game Server Hosting service. To learn how to do this, refer to [Create a build](https://docs.unity.com/ugs/en-us/manual/game-server-hosting/manual/guides/create-a-build).

#### Set up the Matchmaker service

Use the Matchmaker service to connect clients to the servers hosted by Game Server Hosting and control when a server starts. To use this service, [install and set up Matchmaker](https://docs.unity.com/ugs/en-us/manual/matchmaker/manual/get-started).

 **Note**: Name your Queue "Queue01" for the sample to use it automatically.

## Test the dedicated game server sample in multiplayer

To run the dedicated game server sample as a multiplayer game, you can use [Multiplayer Play Mode](https://docs-multiplayer.unity3d.com/mppm/current/about/) to run multiple instances of the game locally, or connect to a friend over the internet. For more information, refer to [Testing locally](https://docs-multiplayer.unity3d.com/netcode/current/tutorials/testing/testing_locally).

To change the total number of players allowed in a single session, do the following:
1. Open the StartupScene
2. In the Hierarchy window, select the **ApplicationEntryPoint** GameObject.
3. In the **ApplicationEntryPoint** component, adjust the numbers in the **Min Players** and **Max Players** fields.
<br><br>

### Use Multiplayer Play Mode to test the dedicated game server sample

Multiplayer Play Mode allows quicker testing iterations without requiring to generate builds. To use this feature, you will first have to [enable one or more virtual players](https://docs-multiplayer.unity3d.com/mppm/current/virtual-players/). Each of those players can be a client or a server. To start testing, assign the server role to either the main editor or a player, then assign the client role to the rest. You can assign those roles using the same dropdown as the one on the main editor. You will then be able to have them connect to each other via direct connection, or have clients connect to a server hosted by Game Server Hosting via Matchmaker if both services are already setup in the dashboard (see the above sections about setting up Game Server Hosting and Matchmaker). However, make sure that the server build that is hosted is up to date.

### Test the dedicated server sample in a build

To generate a build to test the sample locally or over the internet do the following: 
1. Open the Build window (menu: **DedicatedGameServerSample** > **Builds**). 
2. Select the **Toggle...** option for the platform(s) you want to build for.
3. Select **Build Client(s**), **Build Server(s**), or **Build Client(s) and Server(s)** to generate the builds.

### Set up multiplayer in a local server

After you create a build to test the sample, you can run a server build to host the server and run client builds to join the server. To connect to a local server, select **Join with Direct IP** and use the IP address 127.0.0.1.

### Set up multiplayer over the internet

To test the dedicated server sample in multiplayer over the internet, every client needs to use the same build version. This means you need to share the build executables to each client. Once each client has the same build, you can connect using one of the following ways: 
* Use a direct IP address to connect to a server hosted by one of the playtesters. Note: the person hosting the server will need to open their ports and share their public IP address to allow clients to connect to the server. 
* Use the Matchmaker and Game Server Hosting services to connect to a server on the cloud.
Both of these options work in the editor and in Multiplayer Play Mode clones, but a build version stays the same acrross multiple clients. This reduces the risk of incompatibilities if you make any changes in the editor.

#### Use a direct IP address

To use a public IP address to connect players to the server in a client build, do the following: 
1. Run the server executable on a player's machine.
2. [Open the player's port](https://docs-multiplayer.unity3d.com/netcode/current/learn/faq/#what-are-recommendations-for-getting-a-game-connecting-over-the-internet) on the server to allow other players to connect to it.
3. On Clients, enter the opened port and public IP address of the server in the **Join with Direct IP** screen of the game.
