# Open Aware

> Open Aware aims to empower developers with semantic code intelligence by enabling cross-repository analysis of popular open-source libraries through daily updated indexes. It helps users understand code structure, architecture, and patterns beyond local file searches, facilitating better decision-making, feature planning, and debugging. The tool is particularly useful for comparing libraries, researching implementation approaches, or planning contributions — all while being accessible via standard MCP integrations for AI assistants and development environments.

**Remember:**
- Model Context Protocol (MCP)
- Semantic search using vector embeddings
- Multi-repository code analysis
- Deep research agent for architectural understanding
- Context retrieval with language filtering
- Cross-repo intelligence and pattern recognition
