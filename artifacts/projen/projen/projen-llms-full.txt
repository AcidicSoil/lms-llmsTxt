# Getting Started

This guide will walk you through the essential steps to get up and running with a TypeScript project, covering much of 
what you'll typically use. By the end of this guide, you'll have a solid foundation to build and manage your projects 
efficiently with projen.

:::info
Note: While this guide uses TypeScript as an example, projen supports a variety of project types including JavaScript, 
Python, Java, and more. The concepts and steps outlined here can be adapted to other languages and project types as 
well.

## Introduction

Projen helps you manage your project configuration using code. Instead of manually editing configuration files, you 
define your project setup in a single JavaScript or TypeScript file.

## Creating a New TypeScript Project

To create a new TypeScript project, navigate to your desired directory and run:

```bash
mkdir demo
cd demo
npx projen new typescript
```

Replace `typescript` with the type of project you want to create, such as `node` for a Node.js project or `python` for 
a Python project. You can get a complete list of available project types by running `npx projen new --help`.

## Project Configuration

Projen projects are configured using a `.projenrc.ts` file. Here's a basic example for a TypeScript project:

```ts
import { typescript } from 'projen';

const project = new typescript.TypeScriptProject({
  name: 'my-projen-project',
  defaultReleaseBranch: 'main',
  packageManager: NodePackageManager.NPM,
  srcdir: 'src',
  testdir: 'test',
});

project.synth();
```

From this point forward, all changes to files managed by projen will be made in the projen RC file. Depending on the 
project type you choose, the filename will vary slightly but will always start with .projenrc.

For example:

- For a Node.js project, the file will be `.projenrc.js`.
- For a TypeScript project, the file will be `.projenrc.ts`.
- For a Python project, the file will be `.projenrc.py`.
- If you choose to use JSON, the file will be `.projenrc.json`.

Typically, the projen RC file will be in the same language as the project.

## Adding Dependencies

You can add dependencies in two ways: by using projen's API methods or by setting properties in the constructor.

### Using API Methods

To add a runtime dependency:

```ts
project.addDeps('axios');
```

For development dependencies:

```ts
project.addDevDeps('typescript', 'jest');
```

### Setting Dependencies in the Constructor
Alternatively, you can specify dependencies when you create the project:
```ts
import { TypeScriptProject } from 'projen';

const project = new TypeScriptProject({
  name: 'my-projen-project',
  defaultReleaseBranch: 'main',
  packageManager: NodePackageManager.NPM,
  srcdir: 'src',
  testdir: 'test',
  deps: ['axios'], // Configure your runtime dependencies
  devDeps: ['typescript', 'jest'], // Configure your dev dependencies
});

project.synth();
```

## Managing Scripts

Projen allows you to manage npm scripts easily:

```ts
project.addTask('start', {
  exec: 'ts-node src/index.ts',
});
```

## Generating Files

You can generate custom files using projen. For example, to create a README file:

```ts
new SampleReadme(project, {
  contents: `
    # Sample Project Name
    
    > This project is generated using projen.
  `
});
```

## Customizing Project Settings

Projen provides a wide range of options to customize your project settings. Here are some additional examples:

### Custom File Generation:

Generate custom configuration files, scripts, or documentation.

```ts
new JsonFile(project, 'src/config.json', {
  obj: {
    key: 'value',
  },
});
```

### ESLint Configuration:

Configure ESLint settings for code linting.

```ts
project.eslint?.addRules({
  'no-console': 'warn',
  'quotes': ['error', 'single'],
  'semi': ['error', 'always'],
  'indent': ['error', 2],
  'no-unused-vars': 'warn',
  'eqeqeq': 'error',
  'no-trailing-spaces': 'error',
  'eol-last': ['error', 'always'],
  'comma-dangle': ['error', 'only-multiline'],
});
```

### Prettier Configuration:

Customize Prettier settings for code formatting.

```ts
project.prettier?.addOverride({
  files: '*.ts',
  options: {
    singleQuote: true,
    semi: false,
    tabWidth: 2,
    trailingComma: TrailingComma.ES5,
    printWidth: 80,
  },
});
```

### Jest Configuration:

Configure Jest settings for running tests.

```ts
project.jest?.addTestMatch('**/__tests__/**/*.ts');
```

### Publishing Settings:

Customize settings for publishing the package to npm.

```ts
project.package.addField('publishConfig', {
  access: 'public',
});
```

### VSCode Settings:

Configure settings for Visual Studio Code.

```ts
project.vscode?.extensions.addRecommendations('dbaeumer.vscode-eslint', 'esbenp.prettier-vscode');
```

### Docker Configuration:

Add Docker support by generating a Dockerfile.

```ts
project.addFile('Dockerfile', {
  contents: `
    FROM node:14
    WORKDIR /app
    COPY package*.json ./
    RUN npm install
    COPY . .
    CMD ["npm", "start"]
  `,
});
```

### CI/CD Settings:

Add custom CI/CD configurations, such as for GitLab CI or Jenkins.

```ts
new YamlFile(project, '.gitlab-ci.yml', {
  obj: {
    stages: [
      'build',
      'test',
    ],
    build: {
      stage: 'build',
      script: [
        'npm install',
        'npm run build',
      ],
    },
    test: {
      stage: 'test',
      script: [
        'npm test',
      ],
    },
  },
});
```

### Environment Variables:

Manage environment variables for different environments.

```ts
new TextFile(project, '.env', {
  lines: [
    'NODE_ENV=development',
    'API_KEY=your_api_key',
  ],
});
```

## Working with Git

Projen can help you manage your Git settings.

### Git Ignore Settings:

Customize the `.gitignore` file to include or exclude specific files and directories.

```ts
project.gitignore.addPatterns('dist/', 'node_modules/');
```

## Aliasing projen

To simplify using projen, consider creating an alias:

```shell
$ alias pj="npx projen"
```
Add this line to your shell's startup script (e.g., `~/.bashrc` or `~/.zshrc`) for it to persist across sessions. This 
documentation will always spell out commands fully in case you prefer not to use aliases.

## Watching for Changes

If you are making frequent changes to your `.projenrc` file, you can use the `--watch` option to have projen 
automatically re-run whenever the file changes:

```shell
$ npx projen --watch
```

This will help streamline your workflow by ensuring that projen updates are applied immediately as you make changes 
to your configuration file.

## Conclusion

This Quick Start Guide covers a broad range of custom configurations you can use in projen for a TypeScript project. 
With these basics and additional customizations, you can efficiently manage your project's configuration and focus 
on coding. For more advanced features and customization options, refer to the projen documentation.

# FAQ

## How do I remove the license from my project?

Most projects provided by projen have a field called `licensed`, which is set to
`true` by default. This field is used by projen to generate a `LICENSE` file
for your project, defaulting to the Apache-2.0 license. If you are writing
proprietary software and don't want a license file, you can set this field to
`false`:

```ts
const project = new TypeScriptProject({
  licensed: false,
});
```

## What is this .projenrc.json file all about?

For very simple projects that don't need a full `.projenrc` file in a supported language,
a `.projenrc.json` file can be used that contains the same configuration as the other formats.

A usage example can be found for [the skill project for OpenVoiceOS (OVOS), an open source voice assistant](https://github.com/mikejgray/ovos-skill-projen#create-a-new-skill-template). The managed project files can
be updated by running `npx projen`, and the `.projenrc.json` file can be
updated by hand.

:::info
Tasks cannot be defined in `.projenrc.json` files and must be
updated manually.
:::

## How do I specify parameters when I create a project?

projen supports boolean parameters as flags when executing `npx projen new`
commands. For example, to create a new `TypeScriptProject` with the `stale`
option set to `true`, you can run:

```sh
npx projen new typescript --stale
```

String parameters or falsy values can be set as follows:

```sh
npx projen new typescript --mergify=false --authorName="Elad Ben-Israel"
```

# Introduction

Welcome to the projen documentation! This guide will introduce you to projen and explain its purpose and benefits.

## You will learn

- The purpose of projen
- Types of projects you can create with projen

## What is projen?

Projen lets you define and manage complex project configurations through code, generating configuration files from 
well-typed definitions in any [jsii](https://github.com/aws/jsii)-compatible language. For example, you can use TypeScript to define a projen 
project and synthesize files like `package.json`, `tsconfig.json`, `.gitignore`, and GitHub workflow files. Projen 
supports TypeScript, Python, Java, and Golang.

Whether you're a solo developer or part of a large team, projen helps you manage project configurations seamlessly. As 
your project grows, you can easily add new configuration files and workflows.

Unlike traditional scaffolding tools or template generators, projen enforces changes through strongly-typed code. The 
generated files are never manually edited; instead, you update your code and apply changes by running the projen CLI.

Projen ensures consistency across multiple repositories by allowing you to define custom project types. This enables
organizations to create and maintain uniform project templates across a large number of codebases.

# Testing and Debugging

Welcome to the guide on testing and debugging your Projen projects! If you're
new to Projen or testing in general, don't worry — this page is designed to help
you understand and effectively use testing and debugging techniques in your projects.

## Testing

In Projen projects, the most common way to run tests is using a testing
framework called [Jest](https://jestjs.io/). Jest is a JavaScript Testing
Framework with a focus on simplicity.

When you set up your Projen project, you can configure Jest in your projenrc.js
file like this:

```ts
const project = new NodeProject({
  // ...
  jestOptions: {
    jestConfig: {
      testMatch: ["**/*.test.ts"],
    },
  },
});
```

However, most of the time, the default Jest configuration works fine.

jest or any other testing framework can be used to test projen projects. The
following sections will describe some of the common testing patterns in jest.
Feel free to contribute best practices and tips for other testing frameworks.

### Snapshot testing

The most straightforward method for testing projen projects is to use jest's
snapshot testing feature. This feature allows you to take a snapshot of the
project's generated files and compare them to the expected output.

Here's a basic example:

```ts
import { Testing } from "projen/lib/testing";
import { MyProject } from "../src/my-project";

test("snapshot", () => {
  const project = new MyProject();
  const snapshot = Testing.synth(project);
  expect(snapshot).toMatchSnapshot();
});
```

The above test will generate a snapshot of the entire project and compare
it to the expected output. If the snapshot does not match, the test will fail.

You'll quickly find that these types of snapshot tests are unwieldy - it captures
the entire project and it's hard to pinpoint exactly what changed. However, you
can adjust the test to look at the contents of a single file that was generated:

```ts
import { Testing } from "projen/lib/testing";
import { MyProject } from "../src/my-project";

test("snapshot", () => {
  const project = new MyProject();
  const snapshot = Testing.synth(project);
  expect(snapshot["README.md"]).toMatchSnapshot();
});
```

This test will only compare the contents of the `README.md` file to the expected
output. In other words, your snapshot file will only contain the contents of
the `README.md` file and not the entire project tree.

:::note
Generally, if you just want to make sure that the contents of a single file
are consistent, favor snapshot testing over comparing the contents directly.
:::

### Testing file creation

`Testing.synth()` returns a map of all the files that were generated by the
project. You can use this map to identify whether specific files were created.

```ts
import { Testing } from "projen/lib/testing";
import { MyProject } from "../src/my-project";

test("snapshot", () => {
  const project = new MyProject();
  const snapshot = Testing.synth(project);
  expect(snapshot[".github/workflows/release.yml"]).toBeDefined();
});
```

:::info
Note that this type of testing only identifies whether the file exists. It
does not do any content comparison. You likely will want to use this type of
testing in conjunction with snapshot testing.
:::

## Common Issues and Solutions

### Non-Deterministic Snapshot Tests

Snapshot tests should be predictable, but sometimes they fail randomly. This
can happen if your project attempts to modify a file that's already in your project tree.

For example, if your project is trying
to create a `README.md` file, but the project already has a `README.md` file,
you either run into a race condition or one file will overwrite the other
consistently. This is especially common when extending existing projen
projects.

Resolving this issue can be challenging. If you are extending an existing
projen project, you can try removing your `README.md` file code and see if it still
exists in the project tree with a snapshot test. If it does, then something else
in your project code is already creating the file, and you'll need to identify
what that is and either remove it or override it.

#### Example solution

In the example below, we're extending the `NodeProject` class, which already
creates a `README.md` file. In fact, all classes that extend `GitHubProject`
will create a `README.md` file by default. This behavior is controlled by the
`readme` option in the `GitHubProjectOptions` interface.

We can remove the `README.md` file from the base project, which should allow
the one we've hypothetically added in `CustomNodeProject` to be created.

```ts
const project = new CustomNodeProject({
  // ...
  readme: false, // This will disable the readme file in the underlying NodeProject
});

project.synth();
```

Alternately, since we know that the `README.md` file is already being created,
we can remove the code that creates it in `CustomNodeProject` and just use the
one from the base class.

For classes that do not have a `readme` option, you can use the `tryRemoveFile`
option to remove the file from the project tree.

```ts
const project = new CustomNodeProject({
  // ...
});
project.tryRemoveFile("README.md");
```

Note, however, that this will probably also remove the `README.md` file created
from `CustomNodeProject`, so in this particular case, it's probably better to
just disable the `README.md` file in the base class or use it instead of a
custom implementation.

# AWS Cloud Projects

We support two types of projects for cloud development powered by the AWS Cloud
Development Kit (AWS CDK): **apps** and **libraries**. Apps represent complete
cloud applications while libraries vend constructs which can be consumed by
other libraries or by apps. Libraries are published to public or internal
package managers (npm, PyPI, Maven, NuGet, etc) while apps are deployed into AWS
environments.

This section describes features that are available in both cloud libraries and
applications.
See [AWS CDK Construct Library](../../project-types/aws-cdk-construct-library.md) and [AWS CDK Applications](../../api/awscdk.md) for specific details about libraries and applications.

## AWS Lambda Functions

AWS Lambda is a serverless compute platform which executes short running code
within a managed runtime environment.

To define AWS Lambda functions, create a file with a `.lambda.ts` suffix under
the source tree with AWS Lambda handler code.

For example, say we create `src/resize-image.lambda.ts` with the following
content:

```ts
export async function handler(event: any) {
  console.log('I am resizing the image now!');
}
```

Now run:

```sh
$ npx projen
```

You'll notice that a new file `src/resize-image-function.ts` has been added to
your project. This is a generated source file which exports a construct named
`ResizeImageFunction`. This construct is a subclass of
`@aws-cdk/aws-lambda.Function`, bound to your specific handler. This means that
you don't need to specify neither the `code` nor the `runtime` options when you
add it to your app:

```ts
import { ResizeImageFunction } from './resize-image-function.ts';

const handler = new ResizeImageFunction(this, 'ResizeImageFunction', {
  env: {
    FOO: '1234',
  },

  // all lambda options are supported...
});
```

Under the hood, we also added a compilation task to your project which creates a
.zip bundle for each handler. This bundle is created with
[esbuild](https://github.com/evanw/esbuild) and includes only your handler code
and all of its dependencies. This means that you can freely install and use any
dependencies in your project and use them in your handlers. You can manually
bundle your handler by executing the `bundle:HANDLER` or `bundle:watch:HANDLER`
tasks.

To customize this behavior for all functions, use `lambdaOptions` at the project
level. For example:

```ts
const { awscdk } = require('projen');

new AwsCdkConstructLibrary({
  // ...
  lambdaOptions: {
    // target node.js runtime
    runtime: awscdk.LambdaRuntime.NODEJS_22_X,

    bundlingOptions: {
      // list of node modules to exclude from the bundle
      externals: [ 'aws-sdk' ],
      sourcemap: true,
    }
  }
});
```

You can also disable auto-discovery by setting `lambdaAutoDiscover` to
`false` and then create explicitly add a `awscdk.LambdaFunction` component for
each function in your project. This will allow you to perform more
customizations as needed.

```ts
const { awscdk } = require('projen');

const p = new AwsCdkTypeScriptApp({
  lambdaAutoDiscover: false
});

new awscdk.LambdaFunction(p, {
  entrypoint: 'src/foo.lambda.ts', // .lambda.ts extension is still required
  runtime: aws_lambda.Runtime.NODEJS_12_X,
});
```

## AWS Lambda Extensions

An AWS [Lambda Extension][lambda-extensions-blog] is a way to integrate your
preferred development, monitoring, observability, and governance tools with
AWS Lambda.

Functionally, AWS [Lambda Extensions][lambda-extensions-blog] are long-running
executable files that reside in the `extensions` subdirectory of your code
asset. AWS Lambda executes all extensions before starting your handler's main
process. These AWS Lambda Extensions interact with your function's main process
and the [Lambda Extension API][lambda-extensions-api] to integrate with tools
outside the Lambda environment. Projen helps with bundling and preparing your
code as reusable Lambda Layers.

[lambda-extensions-blog]: https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/aws/getting-started-with-using-your-favorite-operational-tools-on-aws-lambda-extensions-are-now-generally-available/
[lambda-extensions-api]: https://docs.aws.amazon.com/lambda/latest/dg/runtimes-extensions-api.html

To create an AWS Lambda Extension with Projen:

- Create a file in your project's source tree called
  `my-extension.lambda-extension.ts`
- Run `npx projen`
- Projen will automatically discover this file, generating an AWS Lambda Layer
  Version named `MyExtensionLayerVersion` in a file named
  `my-extension-layer-version.ts`.
- Now you can instantiate `MyExtensionLayerVersion` and add it to your Lambda
  functions.

Offical AWS extension examples are available in the [AWS Samples][ext-samples]
repository.

[ext-samples]: https://github.com/aws-samples/aws-lambda-extensions

**Example of an extension:**

A skeleton for a Lambda extension follows below. Comments with `TODO` describe
locations where you can provide your custom functionality.

```ts
#!/usr/bin/env node
// ^ Don't forget this shebang - Lambda executes the bundled version of this
// file directly and doesn't otherwise know it's a node script.

import { basename } from 'path';

// This example uses the `got` HTTP client and assumes that you have included
// `got` in your `devDependencies`. But, you can use any HTTP client you like.
import got from 'got';

/**
 * Your Lambda Extension's main loop
 */
async function main() {
  const extensionInfo = await registerExtension([
    ExtensionEventType.SHUTDOWN,
    ExtensionEventType.INVOKE,
  ]);

  // TODO: Put your initialization code here. You can do things like
  // testing a connection to your external tooling here.

  while (true) {
    const event = await getNextEvent(extensionInfo.extensionId);

    switch (event.eventType) {
      case ExtensionEventType.SHUTDOWN:
        // TODO: Do something when the lambda extension is being
        // shut down. You might do things here like de-registering
        // your extension from your external tooling.
        return 0;

      case ExtensionEventType.INVOKE:
        // TODO: Do something every time your function is invoked,
        // such as re-establishing a connection with your external
        // tooling after the Lambda has thawed from a period of
        // freezing due to inactivity.
        break;

      default:
        console.log(`Unhandled event type ${event.eventType}`);
    }
  }
}

const EXTENSION_API_BASE_URL = `http://${process.env.AWS_LAMBDA_RUNTIME_API}/2020-01-01/extension`;

enum ExtensionEventType {
  INVOKE = 'INVOKE',
  SHUTDOWN = 'SHUTDOWN',
}

interface ExtensionEvent {
  readonly eventType: ExtensionEventType;
  // For complete event structures, see:
  // https://docs.aws.amazon.com/lambda/latest/dg/runtimes-extensions-api.html
}

async function registerExtension(events: ExtensionEventType[]) {
  // Do not set a timeout on the GET call, as the extension can be suspended
  // for a period of time until there is an event to return.
  const res = await got.post(`${EXTENSION_API_BASE_URL}/register`, {
    json: { events },
    headers: {
      'Lambda-Extension-Name': basename(__filename),
    },
  });

  const header = res.headers['lambda-extension-identifier'];
  const extensionId = Array.isArray(header) ? header[0] : header;
  const json = JSON.parse(res.body);

  return {
    extensionId,
    functionName: json.functionName as string,
    functionVersion: json.functionVersion as string,
  };
}

function getNextEvent(extensionId: string): Promise<ExtensionEvent> {
  return got(`${EXTENSION_API_BASE_URL}/event/next`, {
    headers: {
      'Lambda-Extension-Identifier': extensionId,
    },
  }).json();
}

main()
  .then(statusCode => {
    process.exit(statusCode);
  })
  .catch(e => {
    console.error(e);
    process.exit(1);
  });
```

## Integration Snapshot Tests

Files in the `test/` tree with the `.integ.ts` suffix are recognized as
*integration snapshot tests*.

Each test is a simple CDK app (e.g. calls `app.synth()`) which exercises certain
construct(s) within the project. A test is considered passing if the app can be
successfully deployed.

To create/update the snapshot, developers are expected to execute the task
`integ:NAME:deploy` with AWS credentials for their personal development
environment. This task will deploy the test app to their account. Upon
successful deployment (i.e. the test passed), the snapshot will be captured and
stored under a directory called `xxx.integ.snapshot` next to the test
entrypoint. This directory should be committed to the repository.

During builds (either local or within a workflow), the task `integ:NAME:assert`
will be executed. This task synthesizes the test app and compares the output to
the captured snapshot. The build will fail if the output differs.

For each integration test, the following set of tasks are created:

| Task                  | Description                                                                                                |
| --------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `integ:NAME:deploy`   | Deploys & destroys the test app and updates the snapshot.                                                  |
| `integ:NAME:assert`   | Synthesizes the test app and compares it with the snapshot (this is the task that runs during build)       |
| `integ:NAME:snapshot` | Synthesizes the test app and updates the snapshot (not recommended to use because it bypasses deployment). |
| `integ:NAME:destroy`  | Destroys a previously deployed test app.                                                                   |

### Writing test assertions

You can write your test assertions as AWS Lambda handlers and use the AWS CDK
[triggers][cdk-trigger-docs] module to execute them as part of the deployment.

Here is an example of a test:

```ts
import { App,Stack } from '@aws-cdk/core';
import { Trigger } from '@aws-cdk/triggers';
import { ConstructUnderTest } from '../src';
import { AssertSomeStuffFunction } from './assert-some-stuff-function.ts'; // <-- generated

const app = new App();
const stack = new Stack(app, 'Test');

// this is the construct we want to test
const testee = new ConstructUnderTest(stack, 'ConstructUnderTest');

// execute a lambda handler with some assertions after all testee
// resources are created
new Trigger(stack, 'RunAssertions', {
  executeAfter: [testee],
  handler: new AssertSomeStuffFunction(stack, 'AssertSomeStuffFunction', {
    env: {
      URL: testee.url // <-- some reference to the created construct
    }
  }),
});
```

[cdk-trigger-docs]:https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cdk/api/v1/docs/triggers-readme.html

## Experimental `integ-runner` integration tests

For TypeScript-based AWS CDK projects, Projen provides experimental support
for using the [`integ-runner`][integ-runner] tool and [library][integ-library]
for integration testing. To enable this feature, you specify
`experimentalIntegRunner: true` in your project options.

[integ-runner]: https://github.com/aws/aws-cdk/tree/main/packages/%40aws-cdk/integ-runner
[integ-library]: https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cdk/api/v2/docs/integ-tests-alpha-readme.html

```typescript
import { awscdk } from 'projen';

new awscdk.AwsCdkConstructLibrary({
  // ...
  experimentalIntegRunner: true
});
```

After enabling experimental `integ-runner` support, all `integ.*.ts` files in
the `test` directory will be automatically discovered and treated as
integration tests. Projen will check that these integration tests match the
committed snapshots at build-time, or whenever the test task is run.

Projen also provides two new commands:

`projen integ [...test names]` - Verifies integration test snapshots. If test
names are provided, only the provided integration tests will be checked.
Otherwise, all integration tests will be checked.

`projen integ:update [...test names]` - Verifies integration test snapshots or
updates the integration test snapshot by re-running the integration test on
failure. Like `projen integ`, you may specify zero or more test names.

> Tests are named based on their file path. For instance, with an integration
> test contained in `test/r53writer/integ.ddbStreamHandler.ts`, the test name
> is `r53writer/integ.ddbStreamHandler`, and you could update the test's
> snapshot by running `projen integ:update r53writer/integ.ddbStreamHandler`.

## Watch

> Only relevant for app projects

The `watch` command will use [cdk watch] in order to trigger deployments (with
opportunistic hot-swapping) when source files or asset bundles are updated.
`cdk.json` will automatically be configured to watch both source code changes
and bundles, and rebuild bundles as needed.

[cdk watch]: https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/developer/increasing-development-speed-with-cdk-watch/

To start watching, set up your environment with AWS credentials and `AWS_REGION`
pointing to your development AWS account and execute:

```sh
npx projen watch
```

This will:

- Bundle your assets (if you have any).
- Perform an initial deployment of your app into your development environment.
- Start watching for changes.

If you change a source file in your project, this change will be picked up by
`cdk watch`, assets will be re-bundled and a hotswap deployment will be
performed. For example, if you only change some AWS Lambda code, the CDK CLI
will simply update the AWS Lambda service with the location of your new code
bundle instead of going through an AWS CloudFormation deployment.

## Roadmap

- Additional bundling targets: web apps, ECS
- Local execution for AWS Lambda, ECS containers, Step Functions
- Support different provisioning engines (CloudFormation/Terraform) using Terraform L2 support
- Generate types for strong-typing AWS Lambda/ECS environment bindings.

# CircleCI Integration

CircleCi uses `.circleci/config.yml` to specify the configuration of a pipeline. 
Configuration reference can be found [here](https://circleci.com/docs/2.0/configuration-reference).

Initial configuration can be created through options of [CircleCiProps](https://github.com/projen/projen/blob/main/src/circleci/model.ts).
Additionally, you can add workflows or orbs later to your pipeline.
For full configuration example checkout [Circleci Tests](https://github.com/projen/projen/blob/main/test/circleci/circleci.test.ts)

```js
const { circleci, typescript } = require('projen');

# Custom Project Installation

This quick start will help you install a pre-created [custom project](../../custom/custom-projects.md).
It's not always clear what project type to pass in if the project's README does not explicitly
tell you.

The basic format to install a custom project is as follows:

```shell
npx projen new $PROJECT_TYPE --from $PACKAGE
```

## Project Type

The `$PROJECT_TYPE` is the type of project you want to create. Using projen's default projects
as examples, if you want to create a TypeScript project, you would pass in `typescript`. If
you want to create a Python project, you would pass in `python`.

The name of the project is typically the name of the exported class, minus the suffix `Project`.
For example, if the project's README says to install a `CustomProject` project, you would pass
in `custom` as the `$PROJECT_TYPE`. Projen's CLI is generally very good about identifying
mis-typed `$PROJECT_TYPE`s, so if you get it wrong, it will tell you.

## Package

The `$PACKAGE` is the name of the package that contains the project you want to install. This
parameter supports anything that your installer supports. Examples can be found
[in the npmjs docs](https://docs.npmjs.com/cli/v10/commands/npm-install?v=true). `yarn`, `pnpm`,
and other package managers generally maintain backwards compatibility with `npm`, so you can
use the same syntax.

## Example

Let's look at a specific example. There is a
[custom project for creating CDKTF providers](https://github.com/cdktf/cdktf-provider-project).
To install it, we would use the following command:

```shell
npx projen new cdktf_provider --from @cdktf/provider-project
```

We would infer that it's `cdktfprovider` because the name of the exported class in `src/main.ts`
is `CdkTfProviderProject`. However, when we try installing that, we get an error:

```shell
👾 Project type "cdktfprovider" not found in "@cdktf/provider-project". Found:

    cdktf_provider

Please specify a valid project type.
Example: npx projen new --from @cdktf/provider-project cdktf_provider
```

In this case the error message is very helpful. It tells us the project type and we can easily
adjust. When we execute the correct command, we get the following output:

```shell
❯ npx projen new cdktf_provider --from @cdktf/provider-project
blank@ /Users/defiance/cdktf-provider-project
└── projen@0.75.1

👾 installing external module @cdktf/provider-project...

up to date, audited 89 packages in 399ms

9 packages are looking for funding
  run `npm fund` for details

found 0 vulnerabilities

👾 Cannot create "@cdktf/provider-project.CdktfProviderProject". Missing required options:
    --cdktf-version [string]
    --constructs-version [string]
    --terraform-provider [string]
```

Here the error message is helpful again. There are required options that must be passed in via
the command line. It tells us the options and the syntax to pass them. We can now install the
project with the following command:

```shell
npx projen new cdktf_provider --from @cdktf/provider-project \
--cdktf-version 0.18.0 \
--constructs-version 10.3.0 \
--terraform-provider aws@5.21.0
```

This command will execute successfully.

Why did we have to pass in those options? This project is designed to be built from a
`.projenrc` file first, with those required variables set. When we use the `--from` flag to
initialize the project, those required variables must be passed in via the command line instead
of the `.projenrc` file.

# GitHub Integration

By default, many projects are initialized with `GitHub` component to enabled GitHub as the default provider for CI/CD workflows. See <https://docs.github.com/en/actions> for more information.

The use of GitHub (and generating corresponding files in `.github`) can be disabled by specifying `github: false` in your project options.

## GitHub API access

Several workflows generated by projen use APIs that are not available through
the permissions of [GITHUB_TOKEN]. To use these workflows, you must provide
either a Personal Access Token (PAT) or a GitHub App to provide API access.

[GITHUB_TOKEN]: https://docs.github.com/en/actions/security-guides/automatic-token-authentication

### Personal Access Token (classic)

Follow the [GitHub docs
instructions](https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/keeping-your-account-and-data-secure/creating-a-personal-access-token#creating-a-personal-access-token-classic)
for creating a personal access token (classic).
When creating the classic PAT, grant the token `repo`, `workflow` and `write:packages` permissions.

Add the token as a secret to your repo under the name `PROJEN_GITHUB_TOKEN`.

### Fine-grained Personal Access Token (beta)

Follow the [GitHub docs
instructions](https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/keeping-your-account-and-data-secure/creating-a-personal-access-token#creating-a-fine-grained-personal-access-token)
for creating a fine-grained personal access token (beta).

Select the repositories you want to use this token for.
You can reuse the same token for multiple repositories if you select them here.
However you should choose the minimal repository access that meets your needs.

Under Permissions, select the following Repository Permissions:

- `Contents` - Read and write
- `Metadata` - Read-only (automatically added)
- `Pull requests` - Read and write
- `Workflows` - Read and write

Add the token as a secret to your repo under the name `PROJEN_GITHUB_TOKEN`.

### GitHub App

Follow the [GitHub docs instructions](https://docs.github.com/en/developers/apps/building-github-apps/creating-a-github-app) for creating a GitHub App. Enable read & write permission for "Contents" and "Pull Request" scopes.

Add the App ID as a secret to your repo under the name `PROJEN_APP_ID` and generate a private key for the app to store as a secret to your repo under the name `PROJEN_APP_PRIVATE_KEY`.

[Install the application](https://docs.github.com/en/apps/using-github-apps/installing-your-own-github-app) ensuring that the repo(s) that you wish to grant access to are selected.

Then, configure your projenrc file to use the GitHub app for API access:

```ts
const { github, javascript } = require('projen');

const project = new javascript.NodeProject({
  // ...other options
  githubOptions: {
    projenCredentials: github.GithubCredentials.fromApp({ ... }),
  },
});
```

If the GitHub app you are using has additional permissions assigned, you can limit the permissions used on the token within the jobs in the workflow to only allow access to write repository contents and create the pull request:

```ts
const { github, javascript } = require('projen');

const project = new javascript.NodeProject({
  // ...other options
  githubOptions: {
    projenCredentials: github.GithubCredentials.fromApp({
      // ...other options
      permissions: {
        pullRequests: github.workflows.AppPermission.WRITE,
        contents: github.workflows.AppPermission.WRITE,
      }
    }),
  },
});
```

## Workflows

See the `GitHub`, `GithubWorkflow`, and `Job` types in the [GitHub](./../../api/github.md) and [GitHub Workflow](./../../api/github.workflows.md) API references for currently available APIs.

Example code of creating a GitHub workflow:
<https://github.com/projen/projen/blob/65b4194c163f47ba4842981b0c92dbe516be787b/src/github/auto-approve.ts#L67-L105>

### Actions versions

Most workflows included with projen are constraint to a major version, in order for updates to be available immediately.
However it is a good security practice to lock versions of GitHub Actions down to explicit commit hashes.
To achieve this, you can define explicit overrides for any action used in workflows.

The replace all occurrences of an action can be overridden, irregardless of the action version:

```ts
project.github.actions.set("actions/checkout", "actions/checkout@ac59398");
```

Any use of `actions/checkout` is now changed to this:

```yaml
steps:
  - uses: actions/checkout@ac59398
```

Alternatively, any specific action version can be overridden.
This can be useful when a specific version of an action must be used due to incompatible changes.
Specific overrides take precedence over overrides without a version.

```ts
project.github.actions.set("actions/checkout@v4", "actions/checkout@ac59398");
project.github.actions.set("actions/checkout", "actions/checkout@main");
```

Different versions of `actions/checkout` are resolved to different overrides:

```yaml
steps:
  # Was: actions/checkout@v4
  - uses: actions/checkout@ac59398

  # Was: actions/checkout@v2
  - uses: actions/checkout@main
```

Workflow creators are encouraged to use commit hashes and keep them updated, or major versions.
Sensitive workflow actions should always use commit hashes.

### Stale workflow

A "stale" workflow can be added which will automatically close issues or pull
requests on your GitHub repository after time has passed without the issue
seeing any comments or updates. You can enable as shown below:

```ts
// or PythonProject, etc.
new typescript.TypeScriptProject({
  stale: true,
  staleOptions: {
    issues: {
      closeMessage: "closing pull request",
      staleLabel: "I-AM-STALE",
      daysBeforeStale: 180,
    },
  }
})
```

Check the API reference for a list of all available options.

When enabled, by default issues with no activity with will be marked as stale
after 60 days and closed within 7 days, and pull requests with no activity will
be marked as stale after 14 days and closed within 2 days.

# GitLab Integration

[GitLab CI/CD](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/ci/yaml/gitlab_ci_yaml.html) uses a `.gitlab-ci.yml` file located at the root of your repository to specify continuous integration and continuous deployment processes. GitLab CI configuration files can be split into multiple files using the [include](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/ci/yaml/#include) fields in order to increase readability or reduce duplication of the same configuration in multiple places.

## Creating a configuration

We support the creation of GitLab CI/CD Configurations through a `CiConfiguration` class and a higher level `GitlabConfiguration` and `NestedConfiguration` classes. To create a GitLab configuration you must first create a [project](../../concepts/projects/index.md) to assign the configuration to.

When using GitLab for CI, the `.gitlab-ci.yml` is always located at the root of the project while other configuration files are located in the `.gitlab\ci-templates\` subdirectory.

```js
const { typescript, gitlab } = require('projen');
const project = new typescript.TypeScriptProject({
  defaultReleaseBranch: 'main',
  name: 'my-project',
});
const gitlabMain = new gitlab.GitlabConfiguration(project,
  {
    jobs: {
      myJob: {
        script: 'echo Hello',
      },
    },
  });
gitlabMain.createNestedTemplates({
  myNestedTemplate: {
    jobs: {
      myOtherJob: {
        script: 'echo World!',
      },
    },
  },
});
project.synth();
```

This creates the following directory structure.

```shell
├── .gitlab-ci.yml
└── .gitlab
    └── ci-templates
         └── mynestedtemplate.yml
```

## Updating Nested Configurations

You can modify a `NestedConfiguration` through the `nestedTemplates` property of a `GitlabConfiguration`.

```js
const { typescript, gitlab } = require('projen');
const project = new typescript.TypeScriptProject({
  defaultReleaseBranch: 'main',
  name: 'my-project',
});
const gitlabMain = new gitlab.GitlabConfiguration(project,
  {
    jobs: {
      myJob: {
        script: 'echo Hello',
      },
    },
  });
gitlabMain.createNestedTemplates({
  myNestedTemplate: {},
});
gitlabMain.nestedTemplates.myNestedTemplate.addStages('stage');
project.synth();
```

# Projects

Projects are the top level component in projen and the entry point for all other components.
They encompass many components, represent a specific type of codebase, and are opinionated, yet flexible.

For example, the [AwsCdkTypeScriptApp](../../api/awscdk.md#awscdktypescriptapp-) represents an [AWS CDK](https://aws.amazon.com/cdk/) application written in TypeScript.
It includes opinionated defaults for the location of source files, the testing framework to use, and automation tools using GitHub Actions.
While many of the specifics can be customized, the project type itself is opinionated and will always produce a codebase that is consistent with other projects of the same type.

There are many different types of projects that ship with projen, and you can also create your own.
Projects that ship with projen are grouped into namespaces, such as 'awscdk', 'java', and 'typescript'.
In the [Getting Started](../../introduction/getting-started.md), the [TypescriptAppProject](../../api/typescript#typescriptappproject-) was used, which comes from the `typescript` namespace.

```typescript
import { typescript } from 'projen';
const project = new typescript.TypeScriptAppProject({
  defaultReleaseBranch: 'main',
  name: 'my-project',
  projenrcTs: true,
  deps: ['express'], // added 'express' to the deps array
});
project.synth();
```

This produces a baseline Typescript application and adds the express dependency to the `package.json` file.

# Architecture

This document attempts to document the high-level architecture of projen. This
could be useful if you're trying to contribute to projen, trying to debug an
error message, or if you're just curious!

## How are a project's files synthesized?

### Bird's eye view

When `npx projen` is run, the command-line process executes the project's
projenrc file. This is usually a file like `.projenrc.js` or `projenrc.java`.

> The "rc" in the name is a common convention for configuration files - see
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Configuration_file.

projenrc files follow a general structure:

1. they define one or more `Project` instances
2. these projects are configured and customized
3. `project.synth()` is called on the root project

For simplicity, most of this document will just assume there is a single project
unless otherwise specified.

Steps 1 and 2 only serve to initialize an in-memory representation of the
project. projen runs on Node.js; so in the JavaScript runtime, these steps
create a hierarchy of objects (called `Component`'s), each with various fields
specifying the names of files, tasks, options, and so on. The data within each
component provides enough information to uniquely determine the structure and
contents of the files it is responsible for. Components can add other components
to the project, and even make changes to existing components through common
interfaces like `project.tasks`, `project.deps`, or
`project.tryFindObjectFile()`.

Step 3 is the only step that actually performs any changes to files in the
user's project / file system.

### Synthesizing actual files

The `synth()` method of `Project` performs the actual synthesizing (and
updating) of all configuration files managed by projen. This is achieved by
deleting all projen-managed files (if there are any), and then re-synthesizing
them based on the latest configuration specified by the user. In code, this
breaks down as follows (slightly simplified):

1. the project's `preSynthesize()` method is called
2. all components' `preSynthesize()` methods are called
3. all projen-synthesized files are cleaned up
4. all components' `synthesize()` methods are called (most files are generated)
5. all components' `postSynthesize()` methods are called
6. the project's `postSynthesize()` method is called

In the above list, step 3 is critical since it's important that only files that
are managed by projen get cleaned up - we don't want user source code to be
deleted! Moreover, if a file was synthesized by projen at one point in time, but
later a user changes their projenrc configuration so it is no longer necessary,
we want it to be automatically cleaned up.

Rather than manually keeping track of synthesized files with some form of stored
state (which could easily get desynced by tampering from users or other tools),
projen simply looks for files with the _magic string_ that you get by
concatenating `"~~ Generated by "` and `"projen"`, and removes them. See
[cleanup.ts](src/cleanup.ts).

Since any file with this string gets automatically cleaned up, you should not
include this magic string verbatim in source code files. If you are writing your
own projen project type or component, you can simply reference this magic string
via `FileBase.PROJEN_MARKER`.

----

Steps 1, 2, 4, 5, and 6 are more straightforward. `synthesize()` is used to
generate the actual files in the user's file system (including applying
appropriate read/write permissions). `preSynthesize()` and `postSynthesize()`
are complementary methods that can used to enable components to perform
additional logic before and after synthesis. See the source code of `Component`
and `FileBase` for more details.

> Note: in practice, there are many existing components for creating specific
> types of files (such as `JsonFile` and `TextFile`), so we recommend using
> these over hand-making components wherever possible. (Believe in the power of
> abstractions!)

Since `preSynthesize()` is called before any files are cleaned up, it can be
used for e.g. observing any changes made to a generated file, and then adjusting
how the file is re-synthesized based on those changes. (As an example, running
`npm install` or `yarn install` can change the dependencies listed in the
`package.json` file of JavaScript projects. The built-in `NodeProject` uses
`preSynthesize()` to automatically integrate these changes to the `package.json`
file synthesized by projen, instead of overriding them.)

## How can projenrc files be written in multiple languages?

The projen library is transpiled by [jsii](https://github.com/aws/jsii) so that
projenrc files can be written in languages besides JavaScript. Under the hood,
API calls made in projen's  Java/Python/etc. libraries communicate with a
JavaScript runtime to deliver the same behavior as if you wrote the code in
JavaScript. For more information, check out [jsii](https://github.com/aws/jsii).

# Contributing to projen

Thanks for your interest in contributing to projen! :heart:

This document describes how to set up a development environment and submit your
contributions. Please read it carefully and let us know if it's not up-to date
(or even better, submit a pull request with your corrections! :wink:).

## Prerequisites

### Manually install tools

The following tools need to be installed to develop on projen locally.

- [Node]
- [Yarn]
- [Maven]
- [Go]
- [git] >= 2.28

[node]: https://nodejs.org/en/download/
[maven]: https://maven.apache.org/install
[go]: https://go.dev/doc/install
[git]: https://git-scm.com/downloads

## Getting Started

The basic commands to get the repository cloned and built locally follow:

```console
$ git clone git@github.com:projen/projen
$ cd projen
$ npm ci # install dependencies
$ npm run build # build projen
```

Attention Windows users: It has been noted that there are compatibility issues between Git Bash and the Projen build script when running on Windows.
Therefore, we recommend directly utilizing the WSL (Windows Subsystem Linux) terminal to build the Projen project.

## Code Organization

Check out [this recording](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8dHwnuSND14) from a walkthrough of the projen codebase.

### Development workflow

The projen package has the following scripts:

- `build` - builds the package and runs all unit tests
- `watch` - watches for file changes and builds them progressively
- `test` - executes all unit tests
- `test:update` - executes all unit tests and overwrites snapshot expectations (those `.snap` files).
- `test:watch` - runs all unit tests and reruns tests when files are changed
- `package` - emits publishable artifacts to `dist`.
- `eslint` - run linter against source code

Each of these scripts can be executed using `npm run <script>` or `npx projen <script>`.

Tests are located under `src/__tests__` and executed from javascript code, so
make sure to compile once before running any tests.

One trick for quickly iterating is to run `npm run watch` in one terminal, and
`npm run test:watch` in another. Then, when you change your unit tests the code
will automatically recompile, thus triggering the tests to automatically re-run.

#### Linting & Formatting

Eslint is used to lint and format our typescript code. The `eslint`
script can be run from the root of the package.

You can integrate the linting and formatting workflow with your editor or ide by
installing the approporiate eslint plugin. For example, when using Visual Studio
Code, the [eslint plugin](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=dbaeumer.vscode-eslint)
exposes a number of options including "fix on save". This will auto correct lint
and formatting errors whenever possible while saving a document.

### Testing against local projects

When your local version of projen builds successfully, you can test it to create
a new project by going into another directory and invoking the binary directly:

First, tell npm to create a link from your local development copy:

```console
$ cd /path/to/local/projen
$ npm link
```

Now, to create new projects:

```console
$ mkdir /my/new/project
$ cd /my/new/project
$ npm link projen
$ alias pj="node_modules/projen/bin/projen"
$ pj new TYPE
$ npm link projen # <-- important to run this again
```

If you already have an existing project and you want to test a new projen
feature against it:

```console
$ cd /my/other/project
$ npm link projen
$ pj
```

From now on, running `pj` in this session will use the local development version of
projen instead of the latest one from npm.

### Version bumping

Currently projen bumps versions automatically thru a GitHub action when a commit
pushed to `main` successfully builds. Projen follows [semantic versioning](https://semver.org/)
through the [commit-and-tag-version](https://github.com/absolute-version/commit-and-tag-version)
npm utility.

## Making a pull request

- Commit title and message (and PR title and description) must adhere to [conventionalcommits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org).
  - The title must begin with `feat(module): title`, `fix(module): title` or `chore(module): title`, where the module refers
    to the projects or components that the change centers on.
    The module can be omitted, so "feat: title" is okay as well.
  - Title should be lowercase.
  - No period at the end of the title.
- Commit message should describe _motivation_. Think about your code reviewers and what information they need in
  order to understand what you did. If it's a big commit (hopefully not), try to provide some good entry points so
  it will be easier to follow.
- Commit message should indicate which issues are fixed: `fixes #<issue>` or `closes #<issue>`.
- Shout out to collaborators.
- If not obvious (i.e. from unit tests), describe how you verified that your change works.
- If this commit includes breaking changes, they must be listed at the end in the following format (notice how multiple breaking changes should be formatted):

```text
BREAKING CHANGE: Description of what broke and how to achieve this behavior now
* **module-name:** Another breaking change
* **module-name:** Yet another breaking change
```

                    GNU AFFERO GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE
                       Version 3, 19 November 2007

 Copyright (C) 2007 Free Software Foundation, Inc. <https://fsf.org/>
 Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies
 of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.

                            Preamble

  The GNU Affero General Public License is a free, copyleft license for
software and other kinds of works, specifically designed to ensure
cooperation with the community in the case of network server software.

  The licenses for most software and other practical works are designed
to take away your freedom to share and change the works.  By contrast,
our General Public Licenses are intended to guarantee your freedom to
share and change all versions of a program--to make sure it remains free
software for all its users.

  When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not
price.  Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you
have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for
them if you wish), that you receive source code or can get it if you
want it, that you can change the software or use pieces of it in new
free programs, and that you know you can do these things.

  Developers that use our General Public Licenses protect your rights
with two steps: (1) assert copyright on the software, and (2) offer
you this License which gives you legal permission to copy, distribute
and/or modify the software.

  A secondary benefit of defending all users' freedom is that
improvements made in alternate versions of the program, if they
receive widespread use, become available for other developers to
incorporate.  Many developers of free software are heartened and
encouraged by the resulting cooperation.  However, in the case of
software used on network servers, this result may fail to come about.
The GNU General Public License permits making a modified version and
letting the public access it on a server without ever releasing its
source code to the public.

  The GNU Affero General Public License is designed specifically to
ensure that, in such cases, the modified source code becomes available
to the community.  It requires the operator of a network server to
provide the source code of the modified version running there to the
users of that server.  Therefore, public use of a modified version, on
a publicly accessible server, gives the public access to the source
code of the modified version.

  An older license, called the Affero General Public License and
published by Affero, was designed to accomplish similar goals.  This is
a different license, not a version of the Affero GPL, but Affero has
released a new version of the Affero GPL which permits relicensing under
this license.

  The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and
modification follow.

                       TERMS AND CONDITIONS

  0. Definitions.

  "This License" refers to version 3 of the GNU Affero General Public License.

  "Copyright" also means copyright-like laws that apply to other kinds of
works, such as semiconductor masks.

  "The Program" refers to any copyrightable work licensed under this
License.  Each licensee is addressed as "you".  "Licensees" and
"recipients" may be individuals or organizations.

  To "modify" a work means to copy from or adapt all or part of the work
in a fashion requiring copyright permission, other than the making of an
exact copy.  The resulting work is called a "modified version" of the
earlier work or a work "based on" the earlier work.

  A "covered work" means either the unmodified Program or a work based
on the Program.

  To "propagate" a work means to do anything with it that, without
permission, would make you directly or secondarily liable for
infringement under applicable copyright law, except executing it on a
computer or modifying a private copy.  Propagation includes copying,
distribution (with or without modification), making available to the
public, and in some countries other activities as well.

  To "convey" a work means any kind of propagation that enables other
parties to make or receive copies.  Mere interaction with a user through
a computer network, with no transfer of a copy, is not conveying.

  An interactive user interface displays "Appropriate Legal Notices"
to the extent that it includes a convenient and prominently visible
feature that (1) displays an appropriate copyright notice, and (2)
tells the user that there is no warranty for the work (except to the
extent that warranties are provided), that licensees may convey the
work under this License, and how to view a copy of this License.  If
the interface presents a list of user commands or options, such as a
menu, a prominent item in the list meets this criterion.

  1. Source Code.

  The "source code" for a work means the preferred form of the work
for making modifications to it.  "Object code" means any non-source
form of a work.

  A "Standard Interface" means an interface that either is an official
standard defined by a recognized standards body, or, in the case of
interfaces specified for a particular programming language, one that
is widely used among developers working in that language.

  The "System Libraries" of an executable work include anything, other
than the work as a whole, that (a) is included in the normal form of
packaging a Major Component, but which is not part of that Major
Component, and (b) serves only to enable use of the work with that
Major Component, or to implement a Standard Interface for which an
implementation is available to the public in source code form.  A
"Major Component", in this context, means a major essential component
(kernel, window system, and so on) of the specific operating system
(if any) on which the executable work runs, or a compiler used to
produce the work, or an object code interpreter used to run it.

  The "Corresponding Source" for a work in object code form means all
the source code needed to generate, install, and (for an executable
work) run the object code and to modify the work, including scripts to
control those activities.  However, it does not include the work's
System Libraries, or general-purpose tools or generally available free
programs which are used unmodified in performing those activities but
which are not part of the work.  For example, Corresponding Source
includes interface definition files associated with source files for
the work, and the source code for shared libraries and dynamically
linked subprograms that the work is specifically designed to require,
such as by intimate data communication or control flow between those
subprograms and other parts of the work.

  The Corresponding Source need not include anything that users
can regenerate automatically from other parts of the Corresponding
Source.

  The Corresponding Source for a work in source code form is that
same work.

  2. Basic Permissions.

  All rights granted under this License are granted for the term of
copyright on the Program, and are irrevocable provided the stated
conditions are met.  This License explicitly affirms your unlimited
permission to run the unmodified Program.  The output from running a
covered work is covered by this License only if the output, given its
content, constitutes a covered work.  This License acknowledges your
rights of fair use or other equivalent, as provided by copyright law.

  You may make, run and propagate covered works that you do not
convey, without conditions so long as your license otherwise remains
in force.  You may convey covered works to others for the sole purpose
of having them make modifications exclusively for you, or provide you
with facilities for running those works, provided that you comply with
the terms of this License in conveying all material for which you do
not control copyright.  Those thus making or running the covered works
for you must do so exclusively on your behalf, under your direction
and control, on terms that prohibit them from making any copies of
your copyrighted material outside their relationship with you.

  Conveying under any other circumstances is permitted solely under
the conditions stated below.  Sublicensing is not allowed; section 10
makes it unnecessary.

  3. Protecting Users' Legal Rights From Anti-Circumvention Law.

  No covered work shall be deemed part of an effective technological
measure under any applicable law fulfilling obligations under article
11 of the WIPO copyright treaty adopted on 20 December 1996, or
similar laws prohibiting or restricting circumvention of such
measures.

  When you convey a covered work, you waive any legal power to forbid
circumvention of technological measures to the extent such circumvention
is effected by exercising rights under this License with respect to
the covered work, and you disclaim any intention to limit operation or
modification of the work as a means of enforcing, against the work's
users, your or third parties' legal rights to forbid circumvention of
technological measures.

  4. Conveying Verbatim Copies.

  You may convey verbatim copies of the Program's source code as you
receive it, in any medium, provided that you conspicuously and
appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate copyright notice;
keep intact all notices stating that this License and any
non-permissive terms added in accord with section 7 apply to the code;
keep intact all notices of the absence of any warranty; and give all
recipients a copy of this License along with the Program.

  You may charge any price or no price for each copy that you convey,
and you may offer support or warranty protection for a fee.

  5. Conveying Modified Source Versions.

  You may convey a work based on the Program, or the modifications to
produce it from the Program, in the form of source code under the
terms of section 4, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:

    a) The work must carry prominent notices stating that you modified
    it, and giving a relevant date.

    b) The work must carry prominent notices stating that it is
    released under this License and any conditions added under section
    7.  This requirement modifies the requirement in section 4 to
    "keep intact all notices".

    c) You must license the entire work, as a whole, under this
    License to anyone who comes into possession of a copy.  This
    License will therefore apply, along with any applicable section 7
    additional terms, to the whole of the work, and all its parts,
    regardless of how they are packaged.  This License gives no
    permission to license the work in any other way, but it does not
    invalidate such permission if you have separately received it.

    d) If the work has interactive user interfaces, each must display
    Appropriate Legal Notices; however, if the Program has interactive
    interfaces that do not display Appropriate Legal Notices, your
    work need not make them do so.

  A compilation of a covered work with other separate and independent
works, which are not by their nature extensions of the covered work,
and which are not combined with it such as to form a larger program,
in or on a volume of a storage or distribution medium, is called an
"aggregate" if the compilation and its resulting copyright are not
used to limit the access or legal rights of the compilation's users
beyond what the individual works permit.  Inclusion of a covered work
in an aggregate does not cause this License to apply to the other
parts of the aggregate.

  6. Conveying Non-Source Forms.

  You may convey a covered work in object code form under the terms
of sections 4 and 5, provided that you also convey the
machine-readable Corresponding Source under the terms of this License,
in one of these ways:

    a) Convey the object code in, or embodied in, a physical product
    (including a physical distribution medium), accompanied by the
    Corresponding Source fixed on a durable physical medium
    customarily used for software interchange.

    b) Convey the object code in, or embodied in, a physical product
    (including a physical distribution medium), accompanied by a
    written offer, valid for at least three years and valid for as
    long as you offer spare parts or customer support for that product
    model, to give anyone who possesses the object code either (1) a
    copy of the Corresponding Source for all the software in the
    product that is covered by this License, on a durable physical
    medium customarily used for software interchange, for a price no
    more than your reasonable cost of physically performing this
    conveying of source, or (2) access to copy the
    Corresponding Source from a network server at no charge.

    c) Convey individual copies of the object code with a copy of the
    written offer to provide the Corresponding Source.  This
    alternative is allowed only occasionally and noncommercially, and
    only if you received the object code with such an offer, in accord
    with subsection 6b.

    d) Convey the object code by offering access from a designated
    place (gratis or for a charge), and offer equivalent access to the
    Corresponding Source in the same way through the same place at no
    further charge.  You need not require recipients to copy the
    Corresponding Source along with the object code.  If the place to
    copy the object code is a network server, the Corresponding Source
    may be on a different server (operated by you or a third party)
    that supports equivalent copying facilities, provided you maintain
    clear directions next to the object code saying where to find the
    Corresponding Source.  Regardless of what server hosts the
    Corresponding Source, you remain obligated to ensure that it is
    available for as long as needed to satisfy these requirements.

    e) Convey the object code using peer-to-peer transmission, provided
    you inform other peers where the object code and Corresponding
    Source of the work are being offered to the general public at no
    charge under subsection 6d.

  A separable portion of the object code, whose source code is excluded
from the Corresponding Source as a System Library, need not be
included in conveying the object code work.

  A "User Product" is either (1) a "consumer product", which means any
tangible personal property which is normally used for personal, family,
or household purposes, or (2) anything designed or sold for incorporation
into a dwelling.  In determining whether a product is a consumer product,
doubtful cases shall be resolved in favor of coverage.  For a particular
product received by a particular user, "normally used" refers to a
typical or common use of that class of product, regardless of the status
of the particular user or of the way in which the particular user
actually uses, or expects or is expected to use, the product.  A product
is a consumer product regardless of whether the product has substantial
commercial, industrial or non-consumer uses, unless such uses represent
the only significant mode of use of the product.

  "Installation Information" for a User Product means any methods,
procedures, authorization keys, or other information required to install
and execute modified versions of a covered work in that User Product from
a modified version of its Corresponding Source.  The information must
suffice to ensure that the continued functioning of the modified object
code is in no case prevented or interfered with solely because
modification has been made.

  If you convey an object code work under this section in, or with, or
specifically for use in, a User Product, and the conveying occurs as
part of a transaction in which the right of possession and use of the
User Product is transferred to the recipient in perpetuity or for a
fixed term (regardless of how the transaction is characterized), the
Corresponding Source conveyed under this section must be accompanied
by the Installation Information.  But this requirement does not apply
if neither you nor any third party retains the ability to install
modified object code on the User Product (for example, the work has
been installed in ROM).

  The requirement to provide Installation Information does not include a
requirement to continue to provide support service, warranty, or updates
for a work that has been modified or installed by the recipient, or for
the User Product in which it has been modified or installed.  Access to a
network may be denied when the modification itself materially and
adversely affects the operation of the network or violates the rules and
protocols for communication across the network.

  Corresponding Source conveyed, and Installation Information provided,
in accord with this section must be in a format that is publicly
documented (and with an implementation available to the public in
source code form), and must require no special password or key for
unpacking, reading or copying.

  7. Additional Terms.

  "Additional permissions" are terms that supplement the terms of this
License by making exceptions from one or more of its conditions.
Additional permissions that are applicable to the entire Program shall
be treated as though they were included in this License, to the extent
that they are valid under applicable law.  If additional permissions
apply only to part of the Program, that part may be used separately
under those permissions, but the entire Program remains governed by
this License without regard to the additional permissions.

  When you convey a copy of a covered work, you may at your option
remove any additional permissions from that copy, or from any part of
it.  (Additional permissions may be written to require their own
removal in certain cases when you modify the work.)  You may place
additional permissions on material, added by you to a covered work,
for which you have or can give appropriate copyright permission.

  Notwithstanding any other provision of this License, for material you
add to a covered work, you may (if authorized by the copyright holders of
that material) supplement the terms of this License with terms:

    a) Disclaiming warranty or limiting liability differently from the
    terms of sections 15 and 16 of this License; or

    b) Requiring preservation of specified reasonable legal notices or
    author attributions in that material or in the Appropriate Legal
    Notices displayed by works containing it; or

    c) Prohibiting misrepresentation of the origin of that material, or
    requiring that modified versions of such material be marked in
    reasonable ways as different from the original version; or

    d) Limiting the use for publicity purposes of names of licensors or
    authors of the material; or

    e) Declining to grant rights under trademark law for use of some
    trade names, trademarks, or service marks; or

    f) Requiring indemnification of licensors and authors of that
    material by anyone who conveys the material (or modified versions of
    it) with contractual assumptions of liability to the recipient, for
    any liability that these contractual assumptions directly impose on
    those licensors and authors.

  All other non-permissive additional terms are considered "further
restrictions" within the meaning of section 10.  If the Program as you
received it, or any part of it, contains a notice stating that it is
governed by this License along with a term that is a further
restriction, you may remove that term.  If a license document contains
a further restriction but permits relicensing or conveying under this
License, you may add to a covered work material governed by the terms
of that license document, provided that the further restriction does
not survive such relicensing or conveying.

  If you add terms to a covered work in accord with this section, you
must place, in the relevant source files, a statement of the
additional terms that apply to those files, or a notice indicating
where to find the applicable terms.

  Additional terms, permissive or non-permissive, may be stated in the
form of a separately written license, or stated as exceptions;
the above requirements apply either way.

  8. Termination.

  You may not propagate or modify a covered work except as expressly
provided under this License.  Any attempt otherwise to propagate or
modify it is void, and will automatically terminate your rights under
this License (including any patent licenses granted under the third
paragraph of section 11).

  However, if you cease all violation of this License, then your
license from a particular copyright holder is reinstated (a)
provisionally, unless and until the copyright holder explicitly and
finally terminates your license, and (b) permanently, if the copyright
holder fails to notify you of the violation by some reasonable means
prior to 60 days after the cessation.

  Moreover, your license from a particular copyright holder is
reinstated permanently if the copyright holder notifies you of the
violation by some reasonable means, this is the first time you have
received notice of violation of this License (for any work) from that
copyright holder, and you cure the violation prior to 30 days after
your receipt of the notice.

  Termination of your rights under this section does not terminate the
licenses of parties who have received copies or rights from you under
this License.  If your rights have been terminated and not permanently
reinstated, you do not qualify to receive new licenses for the same
material under section 10.

  9. Acceptance Not Required for Having Copies.

  You are not required to accept this License in order to receive or
run a copy of the Program.  Ancillary propagation of a covered work
occurring solely as a consequence of using peer-to-peer transmission
to receive a copy likewise does not require acceptance.  However,
nothing other than this License grants you permission to propagate or
modify any covered work.  These actions infringe copyright if you do
not accept this License.  Therefore, by modifying or propagating a
covered work, you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so.

  10. Automatic Licensing of Downstream Recipients.

  Each time you convey a covered work, the recipient automatically
receives a license from the original licensors, to run, modify and
propagate that work, subject to this License.  You are not responsible
for enforcing compliance by third parties with this License.

  An "entity transaction" is a transaction transferring control of an
organization, or substantially all assets of one, or subdividing an
organization, or merging organizations.  If propagation of a covered
work results from an entity transaction, each party to that
transaction who receives a copy of the work also receives whatever
licenses to the work the party's predecessor in interest had or could
give under the previous paragraph, plus a right to possession of the
Corresponding Source of the work from the predecessor in interest, if
the predecessor has it or can get it with reasonable efforts.

  You may not impose any further restrictions on the exercise of the
rights granted or affirmed under this License.  For example, you may
not impose a license fee, royalty, or other charge for exercise of
rights granted under this License, and you may not initiate litigation
(including a cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that
any patent claim is infringed by making, using, selling, offering for
sale, or importing the Program or any portion of it.

  11. Patents.

  A "contributor" is a copyright holder who authorizes use under this
License of the Program or a work on which the Program is based.  The
work thus licensed is called the contributor's "contributor version".

  A contributor's "essential patent claims" are all patent claims
owned or controlled by the contributor, whether already acquired or
hereafter acquired, that would be infringed by some manner, permitted
by this License, of making, using, or selling its contributor version,
but do not include claims that would be infringed only as a
consequence of further modification of the contributor version.  For
purposes of this definition, "control" includes the right to grant
patent sublicenses in a manner consistent with the requirements of
this License.

  Each contributor grants you a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free
patent license under the contributor's essential patent claims, to
make, use, sell, offer for sale, import and otherwise run, modify and
propagate the contents of its contributor version.

  In the following three paragraphs, a "patent license" is any express
agreement or commitment, however denominated, not to enforce a patent
(such as an express permission to practice a patent or covenant not to
sue for patent infringement).  To "grant" such a patent license to a
party means to make such an agreement or commitment not to enforce a
patent against the party.

  If you convey a covered work, knowingly relying on a patent license,
and the Corresponding Source of the work is not available for anyone
to copy, free of charge and under the terms of this License, through a
publicly available network server or other readily accessible means,
then you must either (1) cause the Corresponding Source to be so
available, or (2) arrange to deprive yourself of the benefit of the
patent license for this particular work, or (3) arrange, in a manner
consistent with the requirements of this License, to extend the patent
license to downstream recipients.  "Knowingly relying" means you have
actual knowledge that, but for the patent license, your conveying the
covered work in a country, or your recipient's use of the covered work
in a country, would infringe one or more identifiable patents in that
country that you have reason to believe are valid.

  If, pursuant to or in connection with a single transaction or
arrangement, you convey, or propagate by procuring conveyance of, a
covered work, and grant a patent license to some of the parties
receiving the covered work authorizing them to use, propagate, modify
or convey a specific copy of the covered work, then the patent license
you grant is automatically extended to all recipients of the covered
work and works based on it.

  A patent license is "discriminatory" if it does not include within
the scope of its coverage, prohibits the exercise of, or is
conditioned on the non-exercise of one or more of the rights that are
specifically granted under this License.  You may not convey a covered
work if you are a party to an arrangement with a third party that is
in the business of distributing software, under which you make payment
to the third party based on the extent of your activity of conveying
the work, and under which the third party grants, to any of the
parties who would receive the covered work from you, a discriminatory
patent license (a) in connection with copies of the covered work
conveyed by you (or copies made from those copies), or (b) primarily
for and in connection with specific products or compilations that
contain the covered work, unless you entered into that arrangement,
or that patent license was granted, prior to 28 March 2007.

  Nothing in this License shall be construed as excluding or limiting
any implied license or other defenses to infringement that may
otherwise be available to you under applicable patent law.

  12. No Surrender of Others' Freedom.

  If conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or
otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not
excuse you from the conditions of this License.  If you cannot convey a
covered work so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this
License and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you may
not convey it at all.  For example, if you agree to terms that obligate you
to collect a royalty for further conveying from those to whom you convey
the Program, the only way you could satisfy both those terms and this
License would be to refrain entirely from conveying the Program.

  13. Remote Network Interaction; Use with the GNU General Public License.

  Notwithstanding any other provision of this License, if you modify the
Program, your modified version must prominently offer all users
interacting with it remotely through a computer network (if your version
supports such interaction) an opportunity to receive the Corresponding
Source of your version by providing access to the Corresponding Source
from a network server at no charge, through some standard or customary
means of facilitating copying of software.  This Corresponding Source
shall include the Corresponding Source for any work covered by version 3
of the GNU General Public License that is incorporated pursuant to the
following paragraph.

  Notwithstanding any other provision of this License, you have
permission to link or combine any covered work with a work licensed
under version 3 of the GNU General Public License into a single
combined work, and to convey the resulting work.  The terms of this
License will continue to apply to the part which is the covered work,
but the work with which it is combined will remain governed by version
3 of the GNU General Public License.

  14. Revised Versions of this License.

  The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions of
the GNU Affero General Public License from time to time.  Such new versions
will be similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to
address new problems or concerns.

  Each version is given a distinguishing version number.  If the
Program specifies that a certain numbered version of the GNU Affero General
Public License "or any later version" applies to it, you have the
option of following the terms and conditions either of that numbered
version or of any later version published by the Free Software
Foundation.  If the Program does not specify a version number of the
GNU Affero General Public License, you may choose any version ever published
by the Free Software Foundation.

  If the Program specifies that a proxy can decide which future
versions of the GNU Affero General Public License can be used, that proxy's
public statement of acceptance of a version permanently authorizes you
to choose that version for the Program.

  Later license versions may give you additional or different
permissions.  However, no additional obligations are imposed on any
author or copyright holder as a result of your choosing to follow a
later version.

  15. Disclaimer of Warranty.

  THERE IS NO WARRANTY FOR THE PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY
APPLICABLE LAW.  EXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT
HOLDERS AND/OR OTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE PROGRAM "AS IS" WITHOUT WARRANTY
OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO,
THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR
PURPOSE.  THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE PROGRAM
IS WITH YOU.  SHOULD THE PROGRAM PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST OF
ALL NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION.

  16. Limitation of Liability.

  IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN WRITING
WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MODIFIES AND/OR CONVEYS
THE PROGRAM AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY
GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE
USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE PROGRAM (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF
DATA OR DATA BEING RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU OR THIRD
PARTIES OR A FAILURE OF THE PROGRAM TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER PROGRAMS),
EVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF
SUCH DAMAGES.

  17. Interpretation of Sections 15 and 16.

  If the disclaimer of warranty and limitation of liability provided
above cannot be given local legal effect according to their terms,
reviewing courts shall apply local law that most closely approximates
an absolute waiver of all civil liability in connection with the
Program, unless a warranty or assumption of liability accompanies a
copy of the Program in return for a fee.

                     END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS

            How to Apply These Terms to Your New Programs

  If you develop a new program, and you want it to be of the greatest
possible use to the public, the best way to achieve this is to make it
free software which everyone can redistribute and change under these terms.

  To do so, attach the following notices to the program.  It is safest
to attach them to the start of each source file to most effectively
state the exclusion of warranty; and each file should have at least
the "copyright" line and a pointer to where the full notice is found.

    <one line to give the program's name and a brief idea of what it does.>
    Copyright (C) <year>  <name of author>

    This program is free software: you can redistribute it and/or modify
    it under the terms of the GNU Affero General Public License as published
    by the Free Software Foundation, either version 3 of the License, or
    (at your option) any later version.

    This program is distributed in the hope that it will be useful,
    but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of
    MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  See the
    GNU Affero General Public License for more details.

    You should have received a copy of the GNU Affero General Public License
    along with this program.  If not, see <https://www.gnu.org/licenses/>.

Also add information on how to contact you by electronic and paper mail.

  If your software can interact with users remotely through a computer
network, you should also make sure that it provides a way for users to
get its source.  For example, if your program is a web application, its
interface could display a "Source" link that leads users to an archive
of the code.  There are many ways you could offer source, and different
solutions will be better for different programs; see section 13 for the
specific requirements.

  You should also get your employer (if you work as a programmer) or school,
if any, to sign a "copyright disclaimer" for the program, if necessary.

      source, and configuration files.

      "Object" form shall mean any form resulting from mechanical
      transformation or translation of a Source form, including but
      not limited to compiled object code, generated documentation,
      and conversions to other media types.

      "Work" shall mean the work of authorship, whether in Source or
      Object form, made available under the License, as indicated by a
      copyright notice that is included in or attached to the work
      (an example is provided in the Appendix below).

      "Derivative Works" shall mean any work, whether in Source or Object
      form, that is based on (or derived from) the Work and for which the
      editorial revisions, annotations, elaborations, or other modifications
      represent, as a whole, an original work of authorship. For the purposes
      of this License, Derivative Works shall not include works that remain
      separable from, or merely link (or bind by name) to the interfaces of,
      the Work and Derivative Works thereof.

      "Contribution" shall mean any work of authorship, including
      the original version of the Work and any modifications or additions
      to that Work or Derivative Works thereof, that is intentionally
      submitted to Licensor for inclusion in the Work by the copyright owner
      or by an individual or Legal Entity authorized to submit on behalf of
      the copyright owner. For the purposes of this definition, "submitted"
      means any form of electronic, verbal, or written communication sent

      excluding communication that is conspicuously marked or otherwise
      designated in writing by the copyright owner as "Not a Contribution."

      "Contributor" shall mean Licensor and any individual or Legal Entity
      on behalf of whom a Contribution has been received by Licensor and
      subsequently incorporated within the Work.

   2. Grant of Copyright License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
      this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
      worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
      copyright license to reproduce, prepare Derivative Works of,
      publicly display, publicly perform, sublicense, and distribute the
      Work and such Derivative Works in Source or Object form.

   3. Grant of Patent License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
      this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
      worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
      (except as stated in this section) patent license to make, have made,
      use, offer to sell, sell, import, and otherwise transfer the Work,
      where such license applies only to those patent claims licensable
      by such Contributor that are necessarily infringed by their
      Contribution(s) alone or by combination of their Contribution(s)
      with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was submitted. If You
      institute patent litigation against any entity (including a
      cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work
      or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct
      or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses
      granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate
      as of the date such litigation is filed.

   4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the
      Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without
      modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You
      meet the following conditions:

      (a) You must give any other recipients of the Work or
          Derivative Works a copy of this License; and

      (b) You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices
          stating that You changed the files; and

      (c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works
          that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and
          attribution notices from the Source form of the Work,
          excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of
          the Derivative Works; and

      (d) If the Work includes a "NOTICE" text file as part of its
          distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must
          include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained
          within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not
          pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one
          of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed
          as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or
          documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,
          within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and
          wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents
          of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and
          do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution
          notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside
          or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided
          that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed
          as modifying the License.

      You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and
      may provide additional or different license terms and conditions
      for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or
      for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,
      reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with
      the conditions stated in this License.

   5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,
      any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work
      by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of
      this License, without any additional terms or conditions.
      Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify
      the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed
      with Licensor regarding such Contributions.

   6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade
      names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,
      except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the
      origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.

   7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or
      agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each
      Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS,
      WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or
      implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions
      of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A
      PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the
      appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any
      risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.

   8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,
      whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,
      unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly
      negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
      liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
      incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
      result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
      Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
      work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
      other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
      has been advised of the possibility of such damages.

   9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing
      the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,
      and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,
      or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this
      License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only
      on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf
      of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,
      defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability
      incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason
      of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.

   END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS

   APPENDIX: How to apply the Apache License to your work.

Artistic License 1.0

Preamble

The intent of this document is to state the conditions under which a
Package may be copied, such that the Copyright Holder maintains some
semblance of artistic control over the development of the package, while
giving the users of the package the right to use and distribute the Package
in a more-or-less customary fashion, plus the right to make reasonable
modifications.  Definitions:

"Package" refers to the collection of files distributed by the Copyright
Holder, and derivatives of that collection of files created through textual
modification.

"Standard Version" refers to such a Package if it has not been modified, or
has been modified in accordance with the wishes of the Copyright Holder as
specified below.

"Copyright Holder" is whoever is named in the copyright or copyrights for
the package.

"You" is you, if you're thinking about copying or distributing this
Package.

"Reasonable copying fee" is whatever you can justify on the basis of media
cost, duplication charges, time of people involved, and so on. (You will
not be required to justify it to the Copyright Holder, but only to the
computing community at large as a market that must bear the fee.)

"Freely Available" means that no fee is charged for the item itself, though
there may be fees involved in handling the item. It also means that
recipients of the item may redistribute it under the same conditions they
received it.

1. You may make and give away verbatim copies of the source form of the
Standard Version of this Package without restriction, provided that you
duplicate all of the original copyright notices and associated disclaimers.

2. You may apply bug fixes, portability fixes and other modifications
derived from the Public Domain or from the Copyright Holder. A Package
modified in such a way shall still be considered the Standard Version.

3. You may otherwise modify your copy of this Package in any way, provided
that you insert a prominent notice in each changed file stating how and
when you changed that file, and provided that you do at least ONE of the
following:

a) place your modifications in the Public Domain or otherwise make them
Freely Available, such as by posting said modifications to Usenet or an
equivalent medium, or placing the modifications on a major archive site
such as uunet.uu.net, or by allowing the Copyright Holder to include your
modifications in the Standard Version of the Package.

b) use the modified Package only within your corporation or organization.

c) rename any non-standard executables so the names do not conflict with
standard executables, which must also be provided, and provide a separate
manual page for each non-standard executable that clearly documents how it
differs from the Standard Version.

d) make other distribution arrangements with the Copyright Holder.

4.You may distribute the programs of this Package in object code or
executable form, provided that you do at least ONE of the following:

a) distribute a Standard Version of the executables and library files,
together with instructions (in the manual page or equivalent) on where to
get the Standard Version.

b) accompany the distribution with the machine-readable source of the
Package with your modifications.

c) give non-standard executables non-standard names, and clearly document
the differences in manual pages (or equivalent), together with instructions
on where to get the Standard Version.

d) make other distribution arrangements with the Copyright Holder.

5. You may charge a reasonable copying fee for any distribution of this
Package. You may charge any fee you choose for support of this Package. You
may not charge a fee for this Package itself. However, you may distribute
this Package in aggregate with other (possibly commercial) programs as part
of a larger (possibly commercial) software distribution provided that you
do not advertise this Package as a product of your own. You may embed this
Package's interpreter within an executable of yours (by linking); this
shall be construed as a mere form of aggregation, provided that the
complete Standard Version of the interpreter is so embedded.

6. The scripts and library files supplied as input to or produced as output
from the programs of this Package do not automatically fall under the
copyright of this Package, but belong to whoever generated them, and may be
sold commercially, and may be aggregated with this Package. If such scripts
or library files are aggregated with this Package via the so-called
"undump" or "unexec" methods of producing a binary executable image, then
distribution of such an image shall neither be construed as a distribution
of this Package nor shall it fall under the restrictions of Paragraphs 3
and 4, provided that you do not represent such an executable image as a
Standard Version of this Package.

7. C subroutines (or comparably compiled subroutines in other languages)
supplied by you and linked into this Package in order to emulate
subroutines and variables of the language defined by this Package shall not
be considered part of this Package, but are the equivalent of input as in
Paragraph 6, provided these subroutines do not change the language in any
way that would cause it to fail the regression tests for the language.

8. Aggregation of this Package with a commercial distribution is always
permitted provided that the use of this Package is embedded; that is, when
no overt attempt is made to make this Package's interfaces visible to the
end user of the commercial distribution. Such use shall not be construed as
a distribution of this Package.

9. The name of the Copyright Holder may not be used to endorse or promote
products derived from this software without specific prior written
permission.

10. THIS PACKAGE IS PROVIDED "AS IS" AND WITHOUT ANY EXPRESS OR IMPLIED
WARRANTIES, INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF
MERCHANTIBILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.

The End

Artistic License 2.0
Copyright (c) 2000-2006, The Perl Foundation.

Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies of this
license document, but changing it is not allowed.

Preamble

This license establishes the terms under which a given free software
Package may be copied, modified, distributed, and/or redistributed. The
intent is that the Copyright Holder maintains some artistic control over
the development of that Package while still keeping the Package available
as open source and free software.

You are always permitted to make arrangements wholly outside of this
license directly with the Copyright Holder of a given Package. If the terms
of this license do not permit the full use that you propose to make of the
Package, you should contact the Copyright Holder and seek a different
licensing arrangement.

Definitions

"Copyright Holder" means the individual(s) or organization(s) named in the
copyright notice for the entire Package.

"Contributor" means any party that has contributed code or other material
to the Package, in accordance with the Copyright Holder's procedures.

"You" and "your" means any person who would like to copy, distribute, or
modify the Package.

"Package" means the collection of files distributed by the Copyright
Holder, and derivatives of that collection and/or of those files. A given
Package may consist of either the Standard Version, or a Modified Version.

"Distribute" means providing a copy of the Package or making it accessible
to anyone else, or in the case of a company or organization, to others
outside of your company or organization.

"Distributor Fee" means any fee that you charge for Distributing this
Package or providing support for this Package to another party. It does not
mean licensing fees.

"Standard Version" refers to the Package if it has not been modified, or
has been modified only in ways explicitly requested by the Copyright
Holder.

"Modified Version" means the Package, if it has been changed, and such
changes were not explicitly requested by the Copyright Holder.

"Original License" means this Artistic License as Distributed with the
Standard Version of the Package, in its current version or as it may be
modified by The Perl Foundation in the future.

"Source" form means the source code, documentation source, and
configuration files for the Package.

"Compiled" form means the compiled bytecode, object code, binary, or any
other form resulting from mechanical transformation or translation of the
Source form.

Permission for Use and Modification Without Distribution

(1) You are permitted to use the Standard Version and create and use
Modified Versions for any purpose without restriction, provided that you do
not Distribute the Modified Version.

Permissions for Redistribution of the Standard Version

(2) You may Distribute verbatim copies of the Source form of the Standard
Version of this Package in any medium without restriction, either gratis or
for a Distributor Fee, provided that you duplicate all of the original
copyright notices and associated disclaimers. At your discretion, such
verbatim copies may or may not include a Compiled form of the Package.

(3) You may apply any bug fixes, portability changes, and other
modifications made available from the Copyright Holder. The resulting
Package will still be considered the Standard Version, and as such will be
subject to the Original License.

Distribution of Modified Versions of the Package as Source

(4) You may Distribute your Modified Version as Source (either gratis or
for a Distributor Fee, and with or without a Compiled form of the Modified
Version) provided that you clearly document how it differs from the
Standard Version, including, but not limited to, documenting any
non-standard features, executables, or modules, and provided that you do at
least ONE of the following:

(a) make the Modified Version available to the Copyright Holder of the
Standard Version, under the Original License, so that the Copyright Holder
may include your modifications in the Standard Version.

(b) ensure that installation of your Modified Version does not prevent the
user installing or running the Standard Version. In addition, the Modified
Version must bear a name that is different from the name of the Standard
Version.

(c) allow anyone who receives a copy of the Modified Version to make the
Source form of the Modified Version available to others under

(i) the Original License or

(ii) a license that permits the licensee to freely copy, modify and
redistribute the Modified Version using the same licensing terms that apply
to the copy that the licensee received, and requires that the Source form
of the Modified Version, and of any works derived from it, be made freely
available in that license fees are prohibited but Distributor Fees are
allowed.

Distribution of Compiled Forms of the Standard Version or Modified Versions
without the Source

(5) You may Distribute Compiled forms of the Standard Version without the
Source, provided that you include complete instructions on how to get the
Source of the Standard Version. Such instructions must be valid at the time
of your distribution. If these instructions, at any time while you are
carrying out such distribution, become invalid, you must provide new
instructions on demand or cease further distribution. If you provide valid
instructions or cease distribution within thirty days after you become
aware that the instructions are invalid, then you do not forfeit any of
your rights under this license.

(6) You may Distribute a Modified Version in Compiled form without the
Source, provided that you comply with Section 4 with respect to the Source
of the Modified Version.

Aggregating or Linking the Package

(7) You may aggregate the Package (either the Standard Version or Modified
Version) with other packages and Distribute the resulting aggregation
provided that you do not charge a licensing fee for the Package.
Distributor Fees are permitted, and licensing fees for other components in
the aggregation are permitted. The terms of this license apply to the use
and Distribution of the Standard or Modified Versions as included in the
aggregation.

(8) You are permitted to link Modified and Standard Versions with other
works, to embed the Package in a larger work of your own, or to build
stand-alone binary or bytecode versions of applications that include the
Package, and Distribute the result without restriction, provided the result
does not expose a direct interface to the Package.

Items That are Not Considered Part of a Modified Version

(9) Works (including, but not limited to, modules and scripts) that merely
extend or make use of the Package, do not, by themselves, cause the Package
to be a Modified Version. In addition, such works are not considered parts
of the Package itself, and are not subject to the terms of this license.

General Provisions

(10) Any use, modification, and distribution of the Standard or Modified
Versions is governed by this Artistic License. By using, modifying or
distributing the Package, you accept this license. Do not use, modify, or
distribute the Package, if you do not accept this license.

(11) If your Modified Version has been derived from a Modified Version made
by someone other than you, you are nevertheless required to ensure that
your Modified Version complies with the requirements of this license.

(12) This license does not grant you the right to use any trademark,
service mark, tradename, or logo of the Copyright Holder.

(13) This license includes the non-exclusive, worldwide, free-of-charge
patent license to make, have made, use, offer to sell, sell, import and
otherwise transfer the Package with respect to any patent claims licensable
by the Copyright Holder that are necessarily infringed by the Package. If
you institute patent litigation (including a cross-claim or counterclaim)
against any party alleging that the Package constitutes direct or
contributory patent infringement, then this Artistic License to you shall
terminate on the date that such litigation is filed.

(14) Disclaimer of Warranty: THE PACKAGE IS PROVIDED BY THE COPYRIGHT
HOLDER AND CONTRIBUTORS "AS IS' AND WITHOUT ANY EXPRESS OR IMPLIED
WARRANTIES. THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A
PARTICULAR PURPOSE, OR NON-INFRINGEMENT ARE DISCLAIMED TO THE EXTENT
PERMITTED BY YOUR LOCAL LAW. UNLESS REQUIRED BY LAW, NO COPYRIGHT HOLDER OR
CONTRIBUTOR WILL BE LIABLE FOR ANY DIRECT, INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL, OR
CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING IN ANY WAY OUT OF THE USE OF THE PACKAGE,
EVEN IF ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGE.

                      EUROPEAN UNION PUBLIC LICENCE v. 1.2
                      EUPL © the European Union 2007, 2016

This European Union Public Licence (the ‘EUPL’) applies to the Work (as defined
below) which is provided under the terms of this Licence. Any use of the Work,
other than as authorised under this Licence is prohibited (to the extent such
use is covered by a right of the copyright holder of the Work).

The Work is provided under the terms of this Licence when the Licensor (as
defined below) has placed the following notice immediately following the
copyright notice for the Work:

        Licensed under the EUPL

or has expressed by any other means his willingness to license under the EUPL.

1. Definitions

In this Licence, the following terms have the following meaning:

- ‘The Licence’: this Licence.

- ‘The Original Work’: the work or software distributed or communicated by the
  Licensor under this Licence, available as Source Code and also as Executable
  Code as the case may be.

- ‘Derivative Works’: the works or software that could be created by the
  Licensee, based upon the Original Work or modifications thereof. This Licence
  does not define the extent of modification or dependence on the Original Work
  required in order to classify a work as a Derivative Work; this extent is
  determined by copyright law applicable in the country mentioned in Article 15.

- ‘The Work’: the Original Work or its Derivative Works.

- ‘The Source Code’: the human-readable form of the Work which is the most
  convenient for people to study and modify.

- ‘The Executable Code’: any code which has generally been compiled and which is
  meant to be interpreted by a computer as a program.

- ‘The Licensor’: the natural or legal person that distributes or communicates
  the Work under the Licence.

- ‘Contributor(s)’: any natural or legal person who modifies the Work under the
  Licence, or otherwise contributes to the creation of a Derivative Work.

- ‘The Licensee’ or ‘You’: any natural or legal person who makes any usage of
  the Work under the terms of the Licence.

- ‘Distribution’ or ‘Communication’: any act of selling, giving, lending,
  renting, distributing, communicating, transmitting, or otherwise making
  available, online or offline, copies of the Work or providing access to its
  essential functionalities at the disposal of any other natural or legal
  person.

2. Scope of the rights granted by the Licence

The Licensor hereby grants You a worldwide, royalty-free, non-exclusive,
sublicensable licence to do the following, for the duration of copyright vested
in the Original Work:

- use the Work in any circumstance and for all usage,
- reproduce the Work,
- modify the Work, and make Derivative Works based upon the Work,
- communicate to the public, including the right to make available or display
  the Work or copies thereof to the public and perform publicly, as the case may
  be, the Work,
- distribute the Work or copies thereof,
- lend and rent the Work or copies thereof,
- sublicense rights in the Work or copies thereof.

Those rights can be exercised on any media, supports and formats, whether now
known or later invented, as far as the applicable law permits so.

In the countries where moral rights apply, the Licensor waives his right to
exercise his moral right to the extent allowed by law in order to make effective
the licence of the economic rights here above listed.

The Licensor grants to the Licensee royalty-free, non-exclusive usage rights to
any patents held by the Licensor, to the extent necessary to make use of the
rights granted on the Work under this Licence.

3. Communication of the Source Code

The Licensor may provide the Work either in its Source Code form, or as
Executable Code. If the Work is provided as Executable Code, the Licensor
provides in addition a machine-readable copy of the Source Code of the Work
along with each copy of the Work that the Licensor distributes or indicates, in
a notice following the copyright notice attached to the Work, a repository where
the Source Code is easily and freely accessible for as long as the Licensor
continues to distribute or communicate the Work.

4. Limitations on copyright

Nothing in this Licence is intended to deprive the Licensee of the benefits from
any exception or limitation to the exclusive rights of the rights owners in the
Work, of the exhaustion of those rights or of other applicable limitations
thereto.

5. Obligations of the Licensee

The grant of the rights mentioned above is subject to some restrictions and
obligations imposed on the Licensee. Those obligations are the following:

Attribution right: The Licensee shall keep intact all copyright, patent or
trademarks notices and all notices that refer to the Licence and to the
disclaimer of warranties. The Licensee must include a copy of such notices and a
copy of the Licence with every copy of the Work he/she distributes or
communicates. The Licensee must cause any Derivative Work to carry prominent
notices stating that the Work has been modified and the date of modification.

Copyleft clause: If the Licensee distributes or communicates copies of the
Original Works or Derivative Works, this Distribution or Communication will be
done under the terms of this Licence or of a later version of this Licence
unless the Original Work is expressly distributed only under this version of the
Licence — for example by communicating ‘EUPL v. 1.2 only’. The Licensee
(becoming Licensor) cannot offer or impose any additional terms or conditions on
the Work or Derivative Work that alter or restrict the terms of the Licence.

Compatibility clause: If the Licensee Distributes or Communicates Derivative
Works or copies thereof based upon both the Work and another work licensed under
a Compatible Licence, this Distribution or Communication can be done under the
terms of this Compatible Licence. For the sake of this clause, ‘Compatible
Licence’ refers to the licences listed in the appendix attached to this Licence.
Should the Licensee's obligations under the Compatible Licence conflict with
his/her obligations under this Licence, the obligations of the Compatible
Licence shall prevail.

Provision of Source Code: When distributing or communicating copies of the Work,
the Licensee will provide a machine-readable copy of the Source Code or indicate
a repository where this Source will be easily and freely available for as long
as the Licensee continues to distribute or communicate the Work.

Legal Protection: This Licence does not grant permission to use the trade names,
trademarks, service marks, or names of the Licensor, except as required for
reasonable and customary use in describing the origin of the Work and
reproducing the content of the copyright notice.

6. Chain of Authorship

The original Licensor warrants that the copyright in the Original Work granted
hereunder is owned by him/her or licensed to him/her and that he/she has the
power and authority to grant the Licence.

Each Contributor warrants that the copyright in the modifications he/she brings
to the Work are owned by him/her or licensed to him/her and that he/she has the
power and authority to grant the Licence.

Each time You accept the Licence, the original Licensor and subsequent
Contributors grant You a licence to their contributions to the Work, under the
terms of this Licence.

7. Disclaimer of Warranty

The Work is a work in progress, which is continuously improved by numerous
Contributors. It is not a finished work and may therefore contain defects or
‘bugs’ inherent to this type of development.

For the above reason, the Work is provided under the Licence on an ‘as is’ basis
and without warranties of any kind concerning the Work, including without
limitation merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, absence of defects
or errors, accuracy, non-infringement of intellectual property rights other than
copyright as stated in Article 6 of this Licence.

This disclaimer of warranty is an essential part of the Licence and a condition
for the grant of any rights to the Work.

8. Disclaimer of Liability

Except in the cases of wilful misconduct or damages directly caused to natural
persons, the Licensor will in no event be liable for any direct or indirect,
material or moral, damages of any kind, arising out of the Licence or of the use
of the Work, including without limitation, damages for loss of goodwill, work
stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, loss of data or any commercial
damage, even if the Licensor has been advised of the possibility of such damage.
However, the Licensor will be liable under statutory product liability laws as
far such laws apply to the Work.

9. Additional agreements

While distributing the Work, You may choose to conclude an additional agreement,
defining obligations or services consistent with this Licence. However, if
accepting obligations, You may act only on your own behalf and on your sole
responsibility, not on behalf of the original Licensor or any other Contributor,
and only if You agree to indemnify, defend, and hold each Contributor harmless
for any liability incurred by, or claims asserted against such Contributor by
the fact You have accepted any warranty or additional liability.

10. Acceptance of the Licence

The provisions of this Licence can be accepted by clicking on an icon ‘I agree’
placed under the bottom of a window displaying the text of this Licence or by
affirming consent in any other similar way, in accordance with the rules of
applicable law. Clicking on that icon indicates your clear and irrevocable
acceptance of this Licence and all of its terms and conditions.

Similarly, you irrevocably accept this Licence and all of its terms and
conditions by exercising any rights granted to You by Article 2 of this Licence,
such as the use of the Work, the creation by You of a Derivative Work or the
Distribution or Communication by You of the Work or copies thereof.

11. Information to the public

In case of any Distribution or Communication of the Work by means of electronic
communication by You (for example, by offering to download the Work from a
remote location) the distribution channel or media (for example, a website) must
at least provide to the public the information requested by the applicable law
regarding the Licensor, the Licence and the way it may be accessible, concluded,
stored and reproduced by the Licensee.

12. Termination of the Licence

The Licence and the rights granted hereunder will terminate automatically upon
any breach by the Licensee of the terms of the Licence.

Such a termination will not terminate the licences of any person who has
received the Work from the Licensee under the Licence, provided such persons
remain in full compliance with the Licence.

13. Miscellaneous

Without prejudice of Article 9 above, the Licence represents the complete
agreement between the Parties as to the Work.

If any provision of the Licence is invalid or unenforceable under applicable
law, this will not affect the validity or enforceability of the Licence as a
whole. Such provision will be construed or reformed so as necessary to make it
valid and enforceable.

The European Commission may publish other linguistic versions or new versions of
this Licence or updated versions of the Appendix, so far this is required and
reasonable, without reducing the scope of the rights granted by the Licence. New
versions of the Licence will be published with a unique version number.

All linguistic versions of this Licence, approved by the European Commission,
have identical value. Parties can take advantage of the linguistic version of
their choice.

14. Jurisdiction

Without prejudice to specific agreement between parties,

- any litigation resulting from the interpretation of this License, arising
  between the European Union institutions, bodies, offices or agencies, as a
  Licensor, and any Licensee, will be subject to the jurisdiction of the Court
  of Justice of the European Union, as laid down in article 272 of the Treaty on
  the Functioning of the European Union,

- any litigation arising between other parties and resulting from the
  interpretation of this License, will be subject to the exclusive jurisdiction
  of the competent court where the Licensor resides or conducts its primary
  business.

15. Applicable Law

Without prejudice to specific agreement between parties,

- this Licence shall be governed by the law of the European Union Member State
  where the Licensor has his seat, resides or has his registered office,

- this licence shall be governed by Belgian law if the Licensor has no seat,
  residence or registered office inside a European Union Member State.

                    GNU GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE
                       Version 2, June 1991

 Copyright (C) 1989, 1991 Free Software Foundation, Inc.,
 51 Franklin Street, Fifth Floor, Boston, MA 02110-1301 USA
 Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies
 of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.

                            Preamble

  The licenses for most software are designed to take away your
freedom to share and change it.  By contrast, the GNU General Public
License is intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change free
software--to make sure the software is free for all its users.  This
General Public License applies to most of the Free Software
Foundation's software and to any other program whose authors commit to
using it.  (Some other Free Software Foundation software is covered by
the GNU Lesser General Public License instead.)  You can apply it to
your programs, too.

  When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not
price.  Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you
have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for
this service if you wish), that you receive source code or can get it
if you want it, that you can change the software or use pieces of it
in new free programs; and that you know you can do these things.

  To protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid
anyone to deny you these rights or to ask you to surrender the rights.
These restrictions translate to certain responsibilities for you if you
distribute copies of the software, or if you modify it.

  For example, if you distribute copies of such a program, whether
gratis or for a fee, you must give the recipients all the rights that
you have.  You must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the
source code.  And you must show them these terms so they know their
rights.

  We protect your rights with two steps: (1) copyright the software, and
(2) offer you this license which gives you legal permission to copy,
distribute and/or modify the software.

  Also, for each author's protection and ours, we want to make certain
that everyone understands that there is no warranty for this free
software.  If the software is modified by someone else and passed on, we
want its recipients to know that what they have is not the original, so
that any problems introduced by others will not reflect on the original
authors' reputations.

  Finally, any free program is threatened constantly by software
patents.  We wish to avoid the danger that redistributors of a free
program will individually obtain patent licenses, in effect making the
program proprietary.  To prevent this, we have made it clear that any
patent must be licensed for everyone's free use or not licensed at all.

  The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and
modification follow.

                    GNU GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE
   TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION

  0. This License applies to any program or other work which contains
a notice placed by the copyright holder saying it may be distributed
under the terms of this General Public License.  The "Program", below,
refers to any such program or work, and a "work based on the Program"
means either the Program or any derivative work under copyright law:
that is to say, a work containing the Program or a portion of it,
either verbatim or with modifications and/or translated into another
language.  (Hereinafter, translation is included without limitation in
the term "modification".)  Each licensee is addressed as "you".

Activities other than copying, distribution and modification are not
covered by this License; they are outside its scope.  The act of
running the Program is not restricted, and the output from the Program
is covered only if its contents constitute a work based on the
Program (independent of having been made by running the Program).
Whether that is true depends on what the Program does.

  1. You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Program's
source code as you receive it, in any medium, provided that you
conspicuously and appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate
copyright notice and disclaimer of warranty; keep intact all the
notices that refer to this License and to the absence of any warranty;
and give any other recipients of the Program a copy of this License
along with the Program.

You may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy, and
you may at your option offer warranty protection in exchange for a fee.

  2. You may modify your copy or copies of the Program or any portion
of it, thus forming a work based on the Program, and copy and
distribute such modifications or work under the terms of Section 1
above, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:

    a) You must cause the modified files to carry prominent notices
    stating that you changed the files and the date of any change.

    b) You must cause any work that you distribute or publish, that in
    whole or in part contains or is derived from the Program or any
    part thereof, to be licensed as a whole at no charge to all third
    parties under the terms of this License.

    c) If the modified program normally reads commands interactively
    when run, you must cause it, when started running for such
    interactive use in the most ordinary way, to print or display an
    announcement including an appropriate copyright notice and a
    notice that there is no warranty (or else, saying that you provide
    a warranty) and that users may redistribute the program under
    these conditions, and telling the user how to view a copy of this
    License.  (Exception: if the Program itself is interactive but
    does not normally print such an announcement, your work based on
    the Program is not required to print an announcement.)

These requirements apply to the modified work as a whole.  If
identifiable sections of that work are not derived from the Program,
and can be reasonably considered independent and separate works in
themselves, then this License, and its terms, do not apply to those
sections when you distribute them as separate works.  But when you
distribute the same sections as part of a whole which is a work based
on the Program, the distribution of the whole must be on the terms of
this License, whose permissions for other licensees extend to the
entire whole, and thus to each and every part regardless of who wrote it.

Thus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or contest
your rights to work written entirely by you; rather, the intent is to
exercise the right to control the distribution of derivative or
collective works based on the Program.

In addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on the Program
with the Program (or with a work based on the Program) on a volume of
a storage or distribution medium does not bring the other work under
the scope of this License.

  3. You may copy and distribute the Program (or a work based on it,
under Section 2) in object code or executable form under the terms of
Sections 1 and 2 above provided that you also do one of the following:

    a) Accompany it with the complete corresponding machine-readable
    source code, which must be distributed under the terms of Sections
    1 and 2 above on a medium customarily used for software interchange; or,

    b) Accompany it with a written offer, valid for at least three
    years, to give any third party, for a charge no more than your
    cost of physically performing source distribution, a complete
    machine-readable copy of the corresponding source code, to be
    distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on a medium
    customarily used for software interchange; or,

    c) Accompany it with the information you received as to the offer
    to distribute corresponding source code.  (This alternative is
    allowed only for noncommercial distribution and only if you
    received the program in object code or executable form with such
    an offer, in accord with Subsection b above.)

The source code for a work means the preferred form of the work for
making modifications to it.  For an executable work, complete source
code means all the source code for all modules it contains, plus any
associated interface definition files, plus the scripts used to
control compilation and installation of the executable.  However, as a
special exception, the source code distributed need not include
anything that is normally distributed (in either source or binary
form) with the major components (compiler, kernel, and so on) of the
operating system on which the executable runs, unless that component
itself accompanies the executable.

If distribution of executable or object code is made by offering
access to copy from a designated place, then offering equivalent
access to copy the source code from the same place counts as
distribution of the source code, even though third parties are not
compelled to copy the source along with the object code.

  4. You may not copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute the Program
except as expressly provided under this License.  Any attempt
otherwise to copy, modify, sublicense or distribute the Program is
void, and will automatically terminate your rights under this License.
However, parties who have received copies, or rights, from you under
this License will not have their licenses terminated so long as such
parties remain in full compliance.

  5. You are not required to accept this License, since you have not
signed it.  However, nothing else grants you permission to modify or
distribute the Program or its derivative works.  These actions are
prohibited by law if you do not accept this License.  Therefore, by
modifying or distributing the Program (or any work based on the
Program), you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so, and
all its terms and conditions for copying, distributing or modifying
the Program or works based on it.

  6. Each time you redistribute the Program (or any work based on the
Program), the recipient automatically receives a license from the
original licensor to copy, distribute or modify the Program subject to
these terms and conditions.  You may not impose any further
restrictions on the recipients' exercise of the rights granted herein.
You are not responsible for enforcing compliance by third parties to
this License.

  7. If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of patent
infringement or for any other reason (not limited to patent issues),
conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or
otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not
excuse you from the conditions of this License.  If you cannot
distribute so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this
License and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you
may not distribute the Program at all.  For example, if a patent
license would not permit royalty-free redistribution of the Program by
all those who receive copies directly or indirectly through you, then
the only way you could satisfy both it and this License would be to
refrain entirely from distribution of the Program.

If any portion of this section is held invalid or unenforceable under
any particular circumstance, the balance of the section is intended to
apply and the section as a whole is intended to apply in other
circumstances.

It is not the purpose of this section to induce you to infringe any
patents or other property right claims or to contest validity of any
such claims; this section has the sole purpose of protecting the
integrity of the free software distribution system, which is
implemented by public license practices.  Many people have made
generous contributions to the wide range of software distributed
through that system in reliance on consistent application of that
system; it is up to the author/donor to decide if he or she is willing
to distribute software through any other system and a licensee cannot
impose that choice.

This section is intended to make thoroughly clear what is believed to
be a consequence of the rest of this License.

  8. If the distribution and/or use of the Program is restricted in
certain countries either by patents or by copyrighted interfaces, the
original copyright holder who places the Program under this License
may add an explicit geographical distribution limitation excluding
those countries, so that distribution is permitted only in or among
countries not thus excluded.  In such case, this License incorporates
the limitation as if written in the body of this License.

  9. The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions
of the General Public License from time to time.  Such new versions will
be similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to
address new problems or concerns.

Each version is given a distinguishing version number.  If the Program
specifies a version number of this License which applies to it and "any
later version", you have the option of following the terms and conditions
either of that version or of any later version published by the Free
Software Foundation.  If the Program does not specify a version number of
this License, you may choose any version ever published by the Free Software
Foundation.

  10. If you wish to incorporate parts of the Program into other free
programs whose distribution conditions are different, write to the author
to ask for permission.  For software which is copyrighted by the Free
Software Foundation, write to the Free Software Foundation; we sometimes
make exceptions for this.  Our decision will be guided by the two goals
of preserving the free status of all derivatives of our free software and
of promoting the sharing and reuse of software generally.

                            NO WARRANTY

  11. BECAUSE THE PROGRAM IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, THERE IS NO WARRANTY
FOR THE PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW.  EXCEPT WHEN
OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR OTHER PARTIES
PROVIDE THE PROGRAM "AS IS" WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED
OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF
MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  THE ENTIRE RISK AS
TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE PROGRAM IS WITH YOU.  SHOULD THE
PROGRAM PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING,
REPAIR OR CORRECTION.

  12. IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN WRITING
WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MAY MODIFY AND/OR
REDISTRIBUTE THE PROGRAM AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR DAMAGES,
INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING
OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE PROGRAM (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED
TO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY
YOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A FAILURE OF THE PROGRAM TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER
PROGRAMS), EVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE
POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.

                     END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS

            How to Apply These Terms to Your New Programs

  If you develop a new program, and you want it to be of the greatest
possible use to the public, the best way to achieve this is to make it
free software which everyone can redistribute and change under these terms.

  To do so, attach the following notices to the program.  It is safest
to attach them to the start of each source file to most effectively
convey the exclusion of warranty; and each file should have at least
the "copyright" line and a pointer to where the full notice is found.

    <one line to give the program's name and a brief idea of what it does.>

This General Public License does not permit incorporating your program into
proprietary programs.  If your program is a subroutine library, you may
consider it more useful to permit linking proprietary applications with the
library.  If this is what you want to do, use the GNU Lesser General
Public License instead of this License.

                    GNU GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE
                       Version 3, 29 June 2007

 Copyright (C) 2007 Free Software Foundation, Inc. <http://fsf.org/>
 Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies
 of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.

                            Preamble

  The GNU General Public License is a free, copyleft license for
software and other kinds of works.

  The licenses for most software and other practical works are designed
to take away your freedom to share and change the works.  By contrast,
the GNU General Public License is intended to guarantee your freedom to
share and change all versions of a program--to make sure it remains free
software for all its users.  We, the Free Software Foundation, use the
GNU General Public License for most of our software; it applies also to
any other work released this way by its authors.  You can apply it to
your programs, too.

  When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not
price.  Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you
have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for
them if you wish), that you receive source code or can get it if you
want it, that you can change the software or use pieces of it in new
free programs, and that you know you can do these things.

  To protect your rights, we need to prevent others from denying you
these rights or asking you to surrender the rights.  Therefore, you have
certain responsibilities if you distribute copies of the software, or if
you modify it: responsibilities to respect the freedom of others.

  For example, if you distribute copies of such a program, whether
gratis or for a fee, you must pass on to the recipients the same
freedoms that you received.  You must make sure that they, too, receive
or can get the source code.  And you must show them these terms so they
know their rights.

  Developers that use the GNU GPL protect your rights with two steps:
(1) assert copyright on the software, and (2) offer you this License
giving you legal permission to copy, distribute and/or modify it.

  For the developers' and authors' protection, the GPL clearly explains
that there is no warranty for this free software.  For both users' and
authors' sake, the GPL requires that modified versions be marked as
changed, so that their problems will not be attributed erroneously to
authors of previous versions.

  Some devices are designed to deny users access to install or run
modified versions of the software inside them, although the manufacturer
can do so.  This is fundamentally incompatible with the aim of
protecting users' freedom to change the software.  The systematic
pattern of such abuse occurs in the area of products for individuals to
use, which is precisely where it is most unacceptable.  Therefore, we
have designed this version of the GPL to prohibit the practice for those
products.  If such problems arise substantially in other domains, we
stand ready to extend this provision to those domains in future versions
of the GPL, as needed to protect the freedom of users.

  Finally, every program is threatened constantly by software patents.
States should not allow patents to restrict development and use of
software on general-purpose computers, but in those that do, we wish to
avoid the special danger that patents applied to a free program could
make it effectively proprietary.  To prevent this, the GPL assures that
patents cannot be used to render the program non-free.

  The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and
modification follow.

                       TERMS AND CONDITIONS

  0. Definitions.

  "This License" refers to version 3 of the GNU General Public License.

  "Copyright" also means copyright-like laws that apply to other kinds of
works, such as semiconductor masks.

  "The Program" refers to any copyrightable work licensed under this
License.  Each licensee is addressed as "you".  "Licensees" and
"recipients" may be individuals or organizations.

  To "modify" a work means to copy from or adapt all or part of the work
in a fashion requiring copyright permission, other than the making of an
exact copy.  The resulting work is called a "modified version" of the
earlier work or a work "based on" the earlier work.

  A "covered work" means either the unmodified Program or a work based
on the Program.

  To "propagate" a work means to do anything with it that, without
permission, would make you directly or secondarily liable for
infringement under applicable copyright law, except executing it on a
computer or modifying a private copy.  Propagation includes copying,
distribution (with or without modification), making available to the
public, and in some countries other activities as well.

  To "convey" a work means any kind of propagation that enables other
parties to make or receive copies.  Mere interaction with a user through
a computer network, with no transfer of a copy, is not conveying.

  An interactive user interface displays "Appropriate Legal Notices"
to the extent that it includes a convenient and prominently visible
feature that (1) displays an appropriate copyright notice, and (2)
tells the user that there is no warranty for the work (except to the
extent that warranties are provided), that licensees may convey the
work under this License, and how to view a copy of this License.  If
the interface presents a list of user commands or options, such as a
menu, a prominent item in the list meets this criterion.

  1. Source Code.

  The "source code" for a work means the preferred form of the work
for making modifications to it.  "Object code" means any non-source
form of a work.

  A "Standard Interface" means an interface that either is an official
standard defined by a recognized standards body, or, in the case of
interfaces specified for a particular programming language, one that
is widely used among developers working in that language.

  The "System Libraries" of an executable work include anything, other
than the work as a whole, that (a) is included in the normal form of
packaging a Major Component, but which is not part of that Major
Component, and (b) serves only to enable use of the work with that
Major Component, or to implement a Standard Interface for which an
implementation is available to the public in source code form.  A
"Major Component", in this context, means a major essential component
(kernel, window system, and so on) of the specific operating system
(if any) on which the executable work runs, or a compiler used to
produce the work, or an object code interpreter used to run it.

  The "Corresponding Source" for a work in object code form means all
the source code needed to generate, install, and (for an executable
work) run the object code and to modify the work, including scripts to
control those activities.  However, it does not include the work's
System Libraries, or general-purpose tools or generally available free
programs which are used unmodified in performing those activities but
which are not part of the work.  For example, Corresponding Source
includes interface definition files associated with source files for
the work, and the source code for shared libraries and dynamically
linked subprograms that the work is specifically designed to require,
such as by intimate data communication or control flow between those
subprograms and other parts of the work.

  The Corresponding Source need not include anything that users
can regenerate automatically from other parts of the Corresponding
Source.

  The Corresponding Source for a work in source code form is that
same work.

  2. Basic Permissions.

  All rights granted under this License are granted for the term of
copyright on the Program, and are irrevocable provided the stated
conditions are met.  This License explicitly affirms your unlimited
permission to run the unmodified Program.  The output from running a
covered work is covered by this License only if the output, given its
content, constitutes a covered work.  This License acknowledges your
rights of fair use or other equivalent, as provided by copyright law.

  You may make, run and propagate covered works that you do not
convey, without conditions so long as your license otherwise remains
in force.  You may convey covered works to others for the sole purpose
of having them make modifications exclusively for you, or provide you
with facilities for running those works, provided that you comply with
the terms of this License in conveying all material for which you do
not control copyright.  Those thus making or running the covered works
for you must do so exclusively on your behalf, under your direction
and control, on terms that prohibit them from making any copies of
your copyrighted material outside their relationship with you.

  Conveying under any other circumstances is permitted solely under
the conditions stated below.  Sublicensing is not allowed; section 10
makes it unnecessary.

  3. Protecting Users' Legal Rights From Anti-Circumvention Law.

  No covered work shall be deemed part of an effective technological
measure under any applicable law fulfilling obligations under article
11 of the WIPO copyright treaty adopted on 20 December 1996, or
similar laws prohibiting or restricting circumvention of such
measures.

  When you convey a covered work, you waive any legal power to forbid
circumvention of technological measures to the extent such circumvention
is effected by exercising rights under this License with respect to
the covered work, and you disclaim any intention to limit operation or
modification of the work as a means of enforcing, against the work's
users, your or third parties' legal rights to forbid circumvention of
technological measures.

  4. Conveying Verbatim Copies.

  You may convey verbatim copies of the Program's source code as you
receive it, in any medium, provided that you conspicuously and
appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate copyright notice;
keep intact all notices stating that this License and any
non-permissive terms added in accord with section 7 apply to the code;
keep intact all notices of the absence of any warranty; and give all
recipients a copy of this License along with the Program.

  You may charge any price or no price for each copy that you convey,
and you may offer support or warranty protection for a fee.

  5. Conveying Modified Source Versions.

  You may convey a work based on the Program, or the modifications to
produce it from the Program, in the form of source code under the
terms of section 4, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:

    a) The work must carry prominent notices stating that you modified
    it, and giving a relevant date.

    b) The work must carry prominent notices stating that it is
    released under this License and any conditions added under section
    7.  This requirement modifies the requirement in section 4 to
    "keep intact all notices".

    c) You must license the entire work, as a whole, under this
    License to anyone who comes into possession of a copy.  This
    License will therefore apply, along with any applicable section 7
    additional terms, to the whole of the work, and all its parts,
    regardless of how they are packaged.  This License gives no
    permission to license the work in any other way, but it does not
    invalidate such permission if you have separately received it.

    d) If the work has interactive user interfaces, each must display
    Appropriate Legal Notices; however, if the Program has interactive
    interfaces that do not display Appropriate Legal Notices, your
    work need not make them do so.

  A compilation of a covered work with other separate and independent
works, which are not by their nature extensions of the covered work,
and which are not combined with it such as to form a larger program,
in or on a volume of a storage or distribution medium, is called an
"aggregate" if the compilation and its resulting copyright are not
used to limit the access or legal rights of the compilation's users
beyond what the individual works permit.  Inclusion of a covered work
in an aggregate does not cause this License to apply to the other
parts of the aggregate.

  6. Conveying Non-Source Forms.

  You may convey a covered work in object code form under the terms
of sections 4 and 5, provided that you also convey the
machine-readable Corresponding Source under the terms of this License,
in one of these ways:

    a) Convey the object code in, or embodied in, a physical product
    (including a physical distribution medium), accompanied by the
    Corresponding Source fixed on a durable physical medium
    customarily used for software interchange.

    b) Convey the object code in, or embodied in, a physical product
    (including a physical distribution medium), accompanied by a
    written offer, valid for at least three years and valid for as
    long as you offer spare parts or customer support for that product
    model, to give anyone who possesses the object code either (1) a
    copy of the Corresponding Source for all the software in the
    product that is covered by this License, on a durable physical
    medium customarily used for software interchange, for a price no
    more than your reasonable cost of physically performing this
    conveying of source, or (2) access to copy the
    Corresponding Source from a network server at no charge.

    c) Convey individual copies of the object code with a copy of the
    written offer to provide the Corresponding Source.  This
    alternative is allowed only occasionally and noncommercially, and
    only if you received the object code with such an offer, in accord
    with subsection 6b.

    d) Convey the object code by offering access from a designated
    place (gratis or for a charge), and offer equivalent access to the
    Corresponding Source in the same way through the same place at no
    further charge.  You need not require recipients to copy the
    Corresponding Source along with the object code.  If the place to
    copy the object code is a network server, the Corresponding Source
    may be on a different server (operated by you or a third party)
    that supports equivalent copying facilities, provided you maintain
    clear directions next to the object code saying where to find the
    Corresponding Source.  Regardless of what server hosts the
    Corresponding Source, you remain obligated to ensure that it is
    available for as long as needed to satisfy these requirements.

    e) Convey the object code using peer-to-peer transmission, provided
    you inform other peers where the object code and Corresponding
    Source of the work are being offered to the general public at no
    charge under subsection 6d.

  A separable portion of the object code, whose source code is excluded
from the Corresponding Source as a System Library, need not be
included in conveying the object code work.

  A "User Product" is either (1) a "consumer product", which means any
tangible personal property which is normally used for personal, family,
or household purposes, or (2) anything designed or sold for incorporation
into a dwelling.  In determining whether a product is a consumer product,
doubtful cases shall be resolved in favor of coverage.  For a particular
product received by a particular user, "normally used" refers to a
typical or common use of that class of product, regardless of the status
of the particular user or of the way in which the particular user
actually uses, or expects or is expected to use, the product.  A product
is a consumer product regardless of whether the product has substantial
commercial, industrial or non-consumer uses, unless such uses represent
the only significant mode of use of the product.

  "Installation Information" for a User Product means any methods,
procedures, authorization keys, or other information required to install
and execute modified versions of a covered work in that User Product from
a modified version of its Corresponding Source.  The information must
suffice to ensure that the continued functioning of the modified object
code is in no case prevented or interfered with solely because
modification has been made.

  If you convey an object code work under this section in, or with, or
specifically for use in, a User Product, and the conveying occurs as
part of a transaction in which the right of possession and use of the
User Product is transferred to the recipient in perpetuity or for a
fixed term (regardless of how the transaction is characterized), the
Corresponding Source conveyed under this section must be accompanied
by the Installation Information.  But this requirement does not apply
if neither you nor any third party retains the ability to install
modified object code on the User Product (for example, the work has
been installed in ROM).

  The requirement to provide Installation Information does not include a
requirement to continue to provide support service, warranty, or updates
for a work that has been modified or installed by the recipient, or for
the User Product in which it has been modified or installed.  Access to a
network may be denied when the modification itself materially and
adversely affects the operation of the network or violates the rules and
protocols for communication across the network.

  Corresponding Source conveyed, and Installation Information provided,
in accord with this section must be in a format that is publicly
documented (and with an implementation available to the public in
source code form), and must require no special password or key for
unpacking, reading or copying.

  7. Additional Terms.

  "Additional permissions" are terms that supplement the terms of this
License by making exceptions from one or more of its conditions.
Additional permissions that are applicable to the entire Program shall
be treated as though they were included in this License, to the extent
that they are valid under applicable law.  If additional permissions
apply only to part of the Program, that part may be used separately
under those permissions, but the entire Program remains governed by
this License without regard to the additional permissions.

  When you convey a copy of a covered work, you may at your option
remove any additional permissions from that copy, or from any part of
it.  (Additional permissions may be written to require their own
removal in certain cases when you modify the work.)  You may place
additional permissions on material, added by you to a covered work,
for which you have or can give appropriate copyright permission.

  Notwithstanding any other provision of this License, for material you
add to a covered work, you may (if authorized by the copyright holders of
that material) supplement the terms of this License with terms:

    a) Disclaiming warranty or limiting liability differently from the
    terms of sections 15 and 16 of this License; or

    b) Requiring preservation of specified reasonable legal notices or
    author attributions in that material or in the Appropriate Legal
    Notices displayed by works containing it; or

    c) Prohibiting misrepresentation of the origin of that material, or
    requiring that modified versions of such material be marked in
    reasonable ways as different from the original version; or

    d) Limiting the use for publicity purposes of names of licensors or
    authors of the material; or

    e) Declining to grant rights under trademark law for use of some
    trade names, trademarks, or service marks; or

    f) Requiring indemnification of licensors and authors of that
    material by anyone who conveys the material (or modified versions of
    it) with contractual assumptions of liability to the recipient, for
    any liability that these contractual assumptions directly impose on
    those licensors and authors.

  All other non-permissive additional terms are considered "further
restrictions" within the meaning of section 10.  If the Program as you
received it, or any part of it, contains a notice stating that it is
governed by this License along with a term that is a further
restriction, you may remove that term.  If a license document contains
a further restriction but permits relicensing or conveying under this
License, you may add to a covered work material governed by the terms
of that license document, provided that the further restriction does
not survive such relicensing or conveying.

  If you add terms to a covered work in accord with this section, you
must place, in the relevant source files, a statement of the
additional terms that apply to those files, or a notice indicating
where to find the applicable terms.

  Additional terms, permissive or non-permissive, may be stated in the
form of a separately written license, or stated as exceptions;
the above requirements apply either way.

  8. Termination.

  You may not propagate or modify a covered work except as expressly
provided under this License.  Any attempt otherwise to propagate or
modify it is void, and will automatically terminate your rights under
this License (including any patent licenses granted under the third
paragraph of section 11).

  However, if you cease all violation of this License, then your
license from a particular copyright holder is reinstated (a)
provisionally, unless and until the copyright holder explicitly and
finally terminates your license, and (b) permanently, if the copyright
holder fails to notify you of the violation by some reasonable means
prior to 60 days after the cessation.

  Moreover, your license from a particular copyright holder is
reinstated permanently if the copyright holder notifies you of the
violation by some reasonable means, this is the first time you have
received notice of violation of this License (for any work) from that
copyright holder, and you cure the violation prior to 30 days after
your receipt of the notice.

  Termination of your rights under this section does not terminate the
licenses of parties who have received copies or rights from you under
this License.  If your rights have been terminated and not permanently
reinstated, you do not qualify to receive new licenses for the same
material under section 10.

  9. Acceptance Not Required for Having Copies.

  You are not required to accept this License in order to receive or
run a copy of the Program.  Ancillary propagation of a covered work
occurring solely as a consequence of using peer-to-peer transmission
to receive a copy likewise does not require acceptance.  However,
nothing other than this License grants you permission to propagate or
modify any covered work.  These actions infringe copyright if you do
not accept this License.  Therefore, by modifying or propagating a
covered work, you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so.

  10. Automatic Licensing of Downstream Recipients.

  Each time you convey a covered work, the recipient automatically
receives a license from the original licensors, to run, modify and
propagate that work, subject to this License.  You are not responsible
for enforcing compliance by third parties with this License.

  An "entity transaction" is a transaction transferring control of an
organization, or substantially all assets of one, or subdividing an
organization, or merging organizations.  If propagation of a covered
work results from an entity transaction, each party to that
transaction who receives a copy of the work also receives whatever
licenses to the work the party's predecessor in interest had or could
give under the previous paragraph, plus a right to possession of the
Corresponding Source of the work from the predecessor in interest, if
the predecessor has it or can get it with reasonable efforts.

  You may not impose any further restrictions on the exercise of the
rights granted or affirmed under this License.  For example, you may
not impose a license fee, royalty, or other charge for exercise of
rights granted under this License, and you may not initiate litigation
(including a cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that
any patent claim is infringed by making, using, selling, offering for
sale, or importing the Program or any portion of it.

  11. Patents.

  A "contributor" is a copyright holder who authorizes use under this
License of the Program or a work on which the Program is based.  The
work thus licensed is called the contributor's "contributor version".

  A contributor's "essential patent claims" are all patent claims
owned or controlled by the contributor, whether already acquired or
hereafter acquired, that would be infringed by some manner, permitted
by this License, of making, using, or selling its contributor version,
but do not include claims that would be infringed only as a
consequence of further modification of the contributor version.  For
purposes of this definition, "control" includes the right to grant
patent sublicenses in a manner consistent with the requirements of
this License.

  Each contributor grants you a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free
patent license under the contributor's essential patent claims, to
make, use, sell, offer for sale, import and otherwise run, modify and
propagate the contents of its contributor version.

  In the following three paragraphs, a "patent license" is any express
agreement or commitment, however denominated, not to enforce a patent
(such as an express permission to practice a patent or covenant not to
sue for patent infringement).  To "grant" such a patent license to a
party means to make such an agreement or commitment not to enforce a
patent against the party.

  If you convey a covered work, knowingly relying on a patent license,
and the Corresponding Source of the work is not available for anyone
to copy, free of charge and under the terms of this License, through a
publicly available network server or other readily accessible means,
then you must either (1) cause the Corresponding Source to be so
available, or (2) arrange to deprive yourself of the benefit of the
patent license for this particular work, or (3) arrange, in a manner
consistent with the requirements of this License, to extend the patent
license to downstream recipients.  "Knowingly relying" means you have
actual knowledge that, but for the patent license, your conveying the
covered work in a country, or your recipient's use of the covered work
in a country, would infringe one or more identifiable patents in that
country that you have reason to believe are valid.

  If, pursuant to or in connection with a single transaction or
arrangement, you convey, or propagate by procuring conveyance of, a
covered work, and grant a patent license to some of the parties
receiving the covered work authorizing them to use, propagate, modify
or convey a specific copy of the covered work, then the patent license
you grant is automatically extended to all recipients of the covered
work and works based on it.

  A patent license is "discriminatory" if it does not include within
the scope of its coverage, prohibits the exercise of, or is
conditioned on the non-exercise of one or more of the rights that are
specifically granted under this License.  You may not convey a covered
work if you are a party to an arrangement with a third party that is
in the business of distributing software, under which you make payment
to the third party based on the extent of your activity of conveying
the work, and under which the third party grants, to any of the
parties who would receive the covered work from you, a discriminatory
patent license (a) in connection with copies of the covered work
conveyed by you (or copies made from those copies), or (b) primarily
for and in connection with specific products or compilations that
contain the covered work, unless you entered into that arrangement,
or that patent license was granted, prior to 28 March 2007.

  Nothing in this License shall be construed as excluding or limiting
any implied license or other defenses to infringement that may
otherwise be available to you under applicable patent law.

  12. No Surrender of Others' Freedom.

  If conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or
otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not
excuse you from the conditions of this License.  If you cannot convey a
covered work so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this
License and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you may
not convey it at all.  For example, if you agree to terms that obligate you
to collect a royalty for further conveying from those to whom you convey
the Program, the only way you could satisfy both those terms and this
License would be to refrain entirely from conveying the Program.

  13. Use with the GNU Affero General Public License.

  Notwithstanding any other provision of this License, you have
permission to link or combine any covered work with a work licensed
under version 3 of the GNU Affero General Public License into a single
combined work, and to convey the resulting work.  The terms of this
License will continue to apply to the part which is the covered work,
but the special requirements of the GNU Affero General Public License,
section 13, concerning interaction through a network will apply to the
combination as such.

  14. Revised Versions of this License.

  The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions of
the GNU General Public License from time to time.  Such new versions will
be similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to
address new problems or concerns.

  Each version is given a distinguishing version number.  If the
Program specifies that a certain numbered version of the GNU General
Public License "or any later version" applies to it, you have the
option of following the terms and conditions either of that numbered
version or of any later version published by the Free Software
Foundation.  If the Program does not specify a version number of the
GNU General Public License, you may choose any version ever published
by the Free Software Foundation.

  If the Program specifies that a proxy can decide which future
versions of the GNU General Public License can be used, that proxy's
public statement of acceptance of a version permanently authorizes you
to choose that version for the Program.

  Later license versions may give you additional or different
permissions.  However, no additional obligations are imposed on any
author or copyright holder as a result of your choosing to follow a
later version.

  15. Disclaimer of Warranty.

  THERE IS NO WARRANTY FOR THE PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY
APPLICABLE LAW.  EXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT
HOLDERS AND/OR OTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE PROGRAM "AS IS" WITHOUT WARRANTY
OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO,
THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR
PURPOSE.  THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE PROGRAM
IS WITH YOU.  SHOULD THE PROGRAM PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST OF
ALL NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION.

  16. Limitation of Liability.

  IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN WRITING
WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MODIFIES AND/OR CONVEYS
THE PROGRAM AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY
GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE
USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE PROGRAM (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF
DATA OR DATA BEING RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU OR THIRD
PARTIES OR A FAILURE OF THE PROGRAM TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER PROGRAMS),
EVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF
SUCH DAMAGES.

  17. Interpretation of Sections 15 and 16.

  If the disclaimer of warranty and limitation of liability provided
above cannot be given local legal effect according to their terms,
reviewing courts shall apply local law that most closely approximates
an absolute waiver of all civil liability in connection with the
Program, unless a warranty or assumption of liability accompanies a
copy of the Program in return for a fee.

                     END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS

            How to Apply These Terms to Your New Programs

  If you develop a new program, and you want it to be of the greatest
possible use to the public, the best way to achieve this is to make it
free software which everyone can redistribute and change under these terms.

  To do so, attach the following notices to the program.  It is safest
to attach them to the start of each source file to most effectively
state the exclusion of warranty; and each file should have at least
the "copyright" line and a pointer to where the full notice is found.

    <one line to give the program's name and a brief idea of what it does.>
    Copyright (C) <year>  <name of author>

    This program is free software: you can redistribute it and/or modify
    it under the terms of the GNU General Public License as published by
    the Free Software Foundation, either version 3 of the License, or
    (at your option) any later version.

    This program is distributed in the hope that it will be useful,
    but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of
    MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  See the
    GNU General Public License for more details.

    You should have received a copy of the GNU General Public License
    along with this program.  If not, see <http://www.gnu.org/licenses/>.

Also add information on how to contact you by electronic and paper mail.

  If the program does terminal interaction, make it output a short
notice like this when it starts in an interactive mode:

    <program>  Copyright (C) <year>  <name of author>
    This program comes with ABSOLUTELY NO WARRANTY; for details type `show w'.
    This is free software, and you are welcome to redistribute it
    under certain conditions; type `show c' for details.

The hypothetical commands `show w' and `show c' should show the appropriate
parts of the General Public License.  Of course, your program's commands
might be different; for a GUI interface, you would use an "about box".

  You should also get your employer (if you work as a programmer) or school,
if any, to sign a "copyright disclaimer" for the program, if necessary.
For more information on this, and how to apply and follow the GNU GPL, see
<http://www.gnu.org/licenses/>.

  The GNU General Public License does not permit incorporating your program
into proprietary programs.  If your program is a subroutine library, you
may consider it more useful to permit linking proprietary applications with
the library.  If this is what you want to do, use the GNU Lesser General
Public License instead of this License.  But first, please read
<http://www.gnu.org/philosophy/why-not-lgpl.html>.

GCC RUNTIME LIBRARY EXCEPTION

Version 3.1, 31 March 2009

Copyright (C) 2009 Free Software Foundation, Inc. <http://fsf.org/>

Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies of this
license document, but changing it is not allowed.

This GCC Runtime Library Exception ("Exception") is an additional
permission under section 7 of the GNU General Public License, version
3 ("GPLv3"). It applies to a given file (the "Runtime Library") that
bears a notice placed by the copyright holder of the file stating that
the file is governed by GPLv3 along with this Exception.

When you use GCC to compile a program, GCC may combine portions of
certain GCC header files and runtime libraries with the compiled
program. The purpose of this Exception is to allow compilation of
non-GPL (including proprietary) programs to use, in this way, the
header files and runtime libraries covered by this Exception.

0. Definitions.

A file is an "Independent Module" if it either requires the Runtime
Library for execution after a Compilation Process, or makes use of an
interface provided by the Runtime Library, but is not otherwise based
on the Runtime Library.

"GCC" means a version of the GNU Compiler Collection, with or without
modifications, governed by version 3 (or a specified later version) of
the GNU General Public License (GPL) with the option of using any
subsequent versions published by the FSF.

"GPL-compatible Software" is software whose conditions of propagation,
modification and use would permit combination with GCC in accord with
the license of GCC.

"Target Code" refers to output from any compiler for a real or virtual
target processor architecture, in executable form or suitable for
input to an assembler, loader, linker and/or execution
phase. Notwithstanding that, Target Code does not include data in any
format that is used as a compiler intermediate representation, or used
for producing a compiler intermediate representation.

The "Compilation Process" transforms code entirely represented in
non-intermediate languages designed for human-written code, and/or in
Java Virtual Machine byte code, into Target Code. Thus, for example,
use of source code generators and preprocessors need not be considered
part of the Compilation Process, since the Compilation Process can be
understood as starting with the output of the generators or
preprocessors.

A Compilation Process is "Eligible" if it is done using GCC, alone or
with other GPL-compatible software, or if it is done without using any
work based on GCC. For example, using non-GPL-compatible Software to
optimize any GCC intermediate representations would not qualify as an
Eligible Compilation Process.

1. Grant of Additional Permission.

You have permission to propagate a work of Target Code formed by
combining the Runtime Library with Independent Modules, even if such
propagation would otherwise violate the terms of GPLv3, provided that
all Target Code was generated by Eligible Compilation Processes. You
may then convey such a combination under terms of your choice,
consistent with the licensing of the Independent Modules.

2. No Weakening of GCC Copyleft.

The availability of this Exception does not imply any general
presumption that third-party software is unaffected by the copyleft
requirements of the license of GCC.

# Projen-managed Project Instructions

This project is managed by [projen](https://github.com/projen/projen), a project configuration management tool.

## Important Guidelines

### Task Execution

- **Always use projen for task execution**: Run tasks using `node ./projen.js <task-name>` instead of directly using npm, yarn, or other package managers.
- **Check available tasks**: Look in `.projen/tasks.json` to see all available tasks, their descriptions, and steps.
- **Common tasks**:
  - `node ./projen.js` - Synthesize project configuration files
  - `node ./projen.js build` - Builds the project, including running tests
  - `node ./projen.js test` - Runs tests only
  - `node ./projen.js compile` - Compiles the source code only

### File Modifications

- **DO NOT manually edit generated files**: Files marked with a comment like "~~ Generated by projen. To modify..." should never be edited directly.
- **Modify configuration in .projenrc**: To change project configuration, always edit the `.projenrc.ts`, `.projenrc.py` or `.projenrc.json` etc. file and then run `node ./projen.js` to regenerate the project files.
- **Check .projenrc first**: Before suggesting changes to package.json, tsconfig.json, or other configuration files, always check if these are managed by projen and suggest changes to .projenrc instead.

### Dependencies

- **Add dependencies through projen**: Use the projen configuration to add dependencies instead of manually editing package.json or using npm/yarn install directly.
- **Example**: In .projenrc, use methods like `addDeps()`, `addDevDeps()`, or `addPeerDeps()` to add dependencies.

### Workflow

1. Make changes to .projenrc configuration file
2. Run `node ./projen.js` to synthesize and update generated files
3. Review the changes
4. Commit both .projenrc and the generated files

## Projen Configuration

This project's configuration is defined in the .projenrc file at the root of the repository. All project metadata, dependencies, scripts, and tooling configuration should be managed through this file.

## Additional Resources

- [Projen Documentation](https://projen.io)
- [Projen GitHub Repository](https://github.com/projen/projen)

# Development Best Practices

- **Always run build after changes**: After modifying any source or test file, run `node ./projen.js build` to ensure your changes compile and pass all tests.
- **Task completion criteria**: A task is not considered complete until:
  - All tests pass (`node ./projen.js test`)
  - There are no compilation errors (`node ./projen.js compile`)
  - There are no linting errors (usually part of the build, if not, run the linter defined in tasks.json)
  - The full build succeeds (`node ./projen.js build`)

# Developing projen itself

    - **Avoid running a full build**: It takes a long time. Instead run individual tasks directly.
    - **Run specific tests**: Use `node ./projen.js test test/path-to-test.test.ts` to run specific test files. Prefer this over running all tests.
    - **Always run the linter**: Use `node ./projen.js eslint` to ensure any code is formatted correctly and follows best practices. Use often.

# Projen-managed Project Instructions

This project is managed by [projen](https://github.com/projen/projen), a project configuration management tool.

## Important Guidelines

### Task Execution

- **Always use projen for task execution**: Run tasks using `node ./projen.js <task-name>` instead of directly using npm, yarn, or other package managers.
- **Check available tasks**: Look in `.projen/tasks.json` to see all available tasks, their descriptions, and steps.
- **Common tasks**:
  - `node ./projen.js` - Synthesize project configuration files
  - `node ./projen.js build` - Builds the project, including running tests
  - `node ./projen.js test` - Runs tests only
  - `node ./projen.js compile` - Compiles the source code only

### File Modifications

- **DO NOT manually edit generated files**: Files marked with a comment like "~~ Generated by projen. To modify..." should never be edited directly.
- **Modify configuration in .projenrc**: To change project configuration, always edit the `.projenrc.ts`, `.projenrc.py` or `.projenrc.json` etc. file and then run `node ./projen.js` to regenerate the project files.
- **Check .projenrc first**: Before suggesting changes to package.json, tsconfig.json, or other configuration files, always check if these are managed by projen and suggest changes to .projenrc instead.

### Dependencies

- **Add dependencies through projen**: Use the projen configuration to add dependencies instead of manually editing package.json or using npm/yarn install directly.
- **Example**: In .projenrc, use methods like `addDeps()`, `addDevDeps()`, or `addPeerDeps()` to add dependencies.

### Workflow

1. Make changes to .projenrc configuration file
2. Run `node ./projen.js` to synthesize and update generated files
3. Review the changes
4. Commit both .projenrc and the generated files

## Projen Configuration

This project's configuration is defined in the .projenrc file at the root of the repository. All project metadata, dependencies, scripts, and tooling configuration should be managed through this file.

# Development Best Practices

- **Always run build after changes**: After modifying any source or test file, run `node ./projen.js build` to ensure your changes compile and pass all tests.
- **Task completion criteria**: A task is not considered complete until:
  - All tests pass (`node ./projen.js test`)
  - There are no compilation errors (`node ./projen.js compile`)
  - There are no linting errors (usually part of the build, if not, run the linter defined in tasks.json)
  - The full build succeeds (`node ./projen.js build`)

# Developing projen itself

    - **Avoid running a full build**: It takes a long time. Instead run individual tasks directly.
    - **Run specific tests**: Use `node ./projen.js test test/path-to-test.test.ts` to run specific test files. Prefer this over running all tests.
    - **Always run the linter**: Use `node ./projen.js eslint` to ensure any code is formatted correctly and follows best practices. Use often.

<br/>

*projen* synthesizes project configuration files such as `package.json`,
`tsconfig.json`, `.gitignore`, GitHub Workflows, eslint, jest, etc. from a
well-typed definition written in JavaScript.

As opposed to existing templating/scaffolding tools, *projen* is not a one-off
generator. Synthesized files should never be manually edited (in fact, projen
enforces that). To modify your project setup, users interact with rich
strongly-typed class and execute `projen` to update their project configuration
files.

By defining a custom project type and using projen in multiple repositories, it's
possible to update configuration files and CI/CD workflows across dozens (or
hundreds!?) of projects.

Check out [this talk](https://youtu.be/SOWMPzXtTCw) about projen from its creator.

## Getting Started

*projen* doesn't need to be installed. You will be using [npx](https://docs.npmjs.com/cli/v7/commands/npx) to run *projen* which takes care of all required setup steps.

To create a new project, run the following command and follow the instructions:

```console
$ mkdir my-project
$ cd my-project
$ npx projen new PROJECT-TYPE
🤖 Synthesizing project...
...
```

### Project types

Currently supported project types (use `npx projen new` without a type for a
full list):

> Use `npx projen new PROJECT-TYPE --help` to view a list of command line
> switches that allows you to specify most project options during bootstrapping.
> For example: `npx projen new jsii --author-name "Jerry Berry"`.

The `new` command will create a `.projenrc.js` file which looks like this for
`jsii` projects:

```js
const { JsiiProject } = require('projen');

const project = new JsiiProject({
  authorAddress: "elad.benisrael@gmail.com",
  authorName: "Elad Ben-Israel",
  name: "foobar",
  repository: "https://github.com/eladn/foobar.git",
});

project.synth();
```

This program instantiates the project type with minimal setup, and then calls
`synth()` to synthesize the project files. By default, the `new` command will
also execute this program, which will result in a fully working project.

Once your project is created, you can configure your project by editing
`.projenrc.js` and re-running `npx projen` to synthesize again.

> The files generated by *projen* are considered an "implementation detail" and
> *projen* protects them from being manually edited (most files are marked
> read-only, and an "anti tamper" check is configured in the CI build workflow
> to ensure that files are not updated during build).

For example, to setup PyPI publishing in `jsii` projects, you can use
[`publishToPypi option`](https://projen.io/publisher.html):

```js
const project = new JsiiProject({
  // ...
  publishToPypi: {
    distName: "mydist",
    module: "my_module",
  }
});
```

Run:

```shell
npx projen
```

And you'll notice that your `package.json` file now contains a `python` section in
its `jsii` config and the GitHub `release.yml` workflow includes a PyPI
publishing step.

We recommend to put this in your shell profile, so you can simply run `pj` every
time you update `.projenrc.js`:

```bash
alias pj='npx projen'
```

Most projects come with an assortment of **tasks** that handle various
development activities, from compiling to publishing. Tasks can be and composed
together, and can be run as local commands or turned into GitHub workflows. You
can list all tasks with `npx projen --help`:

```shell
$ npx projen --help
projen [command]

Commands:
  projen new [PROJECT-TYPE-NAME] [OPTIONS]  Creates a new projen project
  projen clobber                            hard resets to HEAD of origin and cleans the local repo
  projen compile                            Only compile
  projen test                               Run tests
  projen build                              Full release build (test+compile)
  projen upgrade                            upgrade dependencies (including projen)
...
```

The `build` task is the same task that's executed in your CI builds. It
typically compiles, lints, tests and packages your module for distribution.

### Shell Completions

If installed as a global package, `projen` includes rich shell tab-completion support. To enable this in your shell, run:

```shell
# Bash
projen completion >> ~/.bashrc

# ZSH
projen completion >> ~/.zshrc
```

## Features

Some examples of features built-in to project types:

* Fully synthesize `package.json`
* Standard npm scripts like `compile`, `build`, `test`, `package`
* eslint
* Jest
* jsii: compile, package, api compatibility checks, API.md
* Bump & release scripts with CHANGELOG generation based on conventional commits
* Automated PR builds
* Automated releases to npm, maven, NuGet and PyPI
* Automated dependency upgrades
* Mergify configuration
* LICENSE file generation
* gitignore + npmignore management
* Node "engines" support with coupling to CI build environment and @types/node
* Anti-tamper: CI builds will fail if a synthesized file is modified manually

## Documentation

## Ecosystem

*projen* takes a "batteries included" approach and aims to offer dozens of different project types out of
the box (we are just getting started). Think `projen new react`, `projen new angular`, `projen new java-maven`,
`projen new awscdk-typescript`, `projen new cdk8s-python` (nothing in projen is tied to javascript or npm!)...

Adding new project types is as simple as submitting a pull request to this repo and exporting a class that
extends `projen.Project` (or one of its derivatives). Projen automatically discovers project types so your
type will immediately be available in `projen new`.

### Projects in external modules

*projen* is bundled with many project types out of the box, but it can also work
with project types and components defined in external jsii modules (the reason
we need jsii is because projen uses the jsii metadata to discover project types
& options in projen new).

Say we have a module in npm called `projen-vuejs` which includes a single project
type for vue.js:

```bash
$ npx projen new --from projen-vuejs
```

If the referenced module includes multiple project types, the type is required.
Switches can also be used to specify initial values based on the project type
APIs. You can also use any package syntax supported by [yarn
add](https://classic.yarnpkg.com/en/docs/cli/add#toc-adding-dependencies) like
`projen-vuejs@1.2.3`, `file:/path/to/local/folder`,
`git@github.com/awesome/projen-vuejs#1.2.3`, etc.

```bash
$ npx projen new --from projen-vuejs@^2 vuejs-ts --description "my awesome vue project"
```

Under the hood, `projen new` will install the `projen-vuejs` module from npm
(version 2.0.0 and above), discover the project types in it and bootstrap the
`vuejs-ts` project type. It will assign the value `"my awesome vue project"` to
the `description` field. If you examine your `.projenrc.js` file, you'll see
that `projen-vuejs` is defined as a dev dependency:

```javascript
const { VueJsProject } = require('projen-vuejs');

const project = new VueJsProject({
  name: 'my-vuejs-sample',
  description: "my awesome vue project",
  // ...
  devDeps: [
    'projen-vuejs'
  ]
});

project.synth();
```

## Roadmap

See [Vision](./VISION.md).

## FAQ

### Do I have to write my configuration in JavaScript?

Not at all! JavaScript is the default, but it's also possible to write it in
Java, Python, TypeScript, or even JSON. This is made
possible by the [jsii](https://github.com/aws/jsii) library which allows us
to write APIs once and generate libraries in several languages. You can choose
a different language by passing the `--projenrc-ts`, `--projenrc-py`, `--projenrc-java`, or
`--projenrc-json` flags when running `projen new`.

Note: using a `.projenrc.json` file to specify configuration only allows
accessing a subset of the entire API - the options which are passed to the
constructor of each project type.

# The vision of projen

This is basically a paper napkin for ideas for the roadmap for the project. Comments/PRs are more than welcome!

## Ecosystem

"Batteries included" is a very powerful concept. It allows users to discover the breadth of their options using a
single experience, instead of having to read the manual for 4 different plugins with horrible versioning conflicts.

On the other hand, one of the goals of projen is to support the ever-increasing amount of tools people use in order to build software,
and to allow teams to use projen internally for their needs and to do that, we must have an open ecosystem which allows anyone to
freely publish and consume components and projects.

So we need to solve a few problems:

- Discovery: projects/components from ecosystem libraries should feel 1st class.
- Velocity: a single codebase can easily manage breaking changes in APIs, but it's much harder to do that at the
  ecosystem level, and usually a source of a lot of frustration.

### Discovery

The desired experience is that `projen new --help` will list all public project types, including types from ecosystem libraries.

A simple solution that may go a long way is to create a "sources" file in the projen repo, and allow anyone to add their library
to the file through a pull request. The source list will be basically names of npm modules. During _build_, we will process this
list by downloading the package information from npm, and injest their `.jsii` manifests into the CLI.

Yes, this means that new sources will be added only when projen is released. But projen is released for every merged PR.

We will also need to indicate major version compatibility of each project/component (see "Velocity" below).

### Velocity

In semver (semantic versioning), the only right way to introduce a breaking change (API or behavioral) is to release
a new major version. It will take a couple of years for projen to stabilize, and we want the ecosystem to grow with it.
A monolithic module makes this less of a problem because there aren't many libraries that depend on projen, so a major
version once in a while is tolerable.

This means that projen will release major versions all the time. Think 232.4.34.

So we need our ecosystem to continuously take updates and release new versions that were tested with the new major version.
In most cases, projects and component won't get broken, but sometimes they will and then the maintainer will need to resolve.
Luckily this mechanism already exists in projen (`projenUpgradeSecret`).
It is opt-in because it requires a the user to upload a GitHub secret, but maybe if we implement some support for secret management,
we could make that the default behavior.

As mentioned above, when we process our "sources" during build, we can check the projen version they were tested with and
determine if it's compatible with the version on the user's system.

## Services

projen should be able to deploy & manage cloud services related to your development environment. For example,
a service to manage secrets for me in AWS Secrets Manager, a cloud development account, CI/CD infrastructure, etc.

Using the CDKs (AWS CDK, CDK for Terraform, CDK for Kubernetes), complete services can be expressed as constructs
and shared and published as libraries. It is fairly easy (#) to simply allow CDK constructs to be freely used
inside projen components.

## Ideas

- [ ] Components: re-think/re-factor how components and projects interact to allow more modular and composable usage.
- [ ] Discoverability of external components/modules through the CLI
- [ ] Support projenrc in YAML (fully declarative, if one desires)
- [x] CLI bash completion
- [ ] License checking (non CDK specific)
- [ ] Multi-repository projects (alternative to mono-repos)
- [ ] IDE integration (e.g. task execution)
- [ ] Support multiple workflow engines (currently only GitHub is supported)

# Projen-managed Project Instructions

This project is managed by [projen](https://github.com/projen/projen), a project configuration management tool.

## Important Guidelines

### Task Execution

- **Always use projen for task execution**: Run tasks using `node ./projen.js <task-name>` instead of directly using npm, yarn, or other package managers.
- **Check available tasks**: Look in `.projen/tasks.json` to see all available tasks, their descriptions, and steps.
- **Common tasks**:
  - `node ./projen.js` - Synthesize project configuration files
  - `node ./projen.js build` - Builds the project, including running tests
  - `node ./projen.js test` - Runs tests only
  - `node ./projen.js compile` - Compiles the source code only

### File Modifications

- **DO NOT manually edit generated files**: Files marked with a comment like "~~ Generated by projen. To modify..." should never be edited directly.
- **Modify configuration in .projenrc**: To change project configuration, always edit the `.projenrc.ts`, `.projenrc.py` or `.projenrc.json` etc. file and then run `node ./projen.js` to regenerate the project files.
- **Check .projenrc first**: Before suggesting changes to package.json, tsconfig.json, or other configuration files, always check if these are managed by projen and suggest changes to .projenrc instead.

### Dependencies

- **Add dependencies through projen**: Use the projen configuration to add dependencies instead of manually editing package.json or using npm/yarn install directly.
- **Example**: In .projenrc, use methods like `addDeps()`, `addDevDeps()`, or `addPeerDeps()` to add dependencies.

### Workflow

1. Make changes to .projenrc configuration file
2. Run `node ./projen.js` to synthesize and update generated files
3. Review the changes
4. Commit both .projenrc and the generated files

## Projen Configuration

This project's configuration is defined in the .projenrc file at the root of the repository. All project metadata, dependencies, scripts, and tooling configuration should be managed through this file.

# Development Best Practices

- **Always run build after changes**: After modifying any source or test file, run `node ./projen.js build` to ensure your changes compile and pass all tests.
- **Task completion criteria**: A task is not considered complete until:
  - All tests pass (`node ./projen.js test`)
  - There are no compilation errors (`node ./projen.js compile`)
  - There are no linting errors (usually part of the build, if not, run the linter defined in tasks.json)
  - The full build succeeds (`node ./projen.js build`)

# Developing projen itself

    - **Avoid running a full build**: It takes a long time. Instead run individual tasks directly.
    - **Run specific tests**: Use `node ./projen.js test test/path-to-test.test.ts` to run specific test files. Prefer this over running all tests.
    - **Always run the linter**: Use `node ./projen.js eslint` to ensure any code is formatted correctly and follows best practices. Use often.

# Docs

The docs for projen are managed in this directory and are powered by [docusaurus](https://docusaurus.io/).

## Contributing

Follow the [docusaurus docs](https://docusaurus.io/docs/en/navigation) to learn how to edit the docs.

All documentation should be in the project's root `/docs` folder, and not in this docusaurus directory.

## Running the docusaurus server

```bash
npm ci
npm run start
```

## Builds API docs

Generated API docs are committed to the repo, but if you've been making changes and would like to see how they're
reflected in the docs, you can generate them:

```bash
$ npm run docgen
```

This will generate the API docs in `docs/api`.

# External GitHub Repository Settings (RFC #1014)

> **Author**: [@eladb](https://github.com/eladb), **Status**: Draft

Projen is great for managing project-related configuration that is modeled in
files within the git repository. Much of GitHub's configuration (such as issue
templates, workflows, etc) is managed through files under `.github` and to that
extend, projen lends itself well to maintain these files.

However, there are some GitHub repository settings that are not managed through
files in the repos. These include things like branch protection rules,
auto-merge options, and most noteable are repository secrets. Projen heavily
relies on repository secrets for things like publishing tokens.

When maintaining many projects, managing publishing secrets becomes a major
burden. It is also error prone and has potential security implications. Ideally
these secrets should be managed by tooling and not by humans.

GitHub offers some support for centrally managing secrets but these require
organization-level permissions which are not always available.

## README (working backwards)

Let’s say we have a JSII project. By default, it does not publish to PyPI. Let's
add Python publishing to our project.

First, we need edit your `projenrc.js` file and add the `publishToPyPi` setting.
Additionally, set the `secrets` option to tell Projen to retrieve secrets from
AWS Secrets Manager (in the future other secret sources will be supported):

```js
const projen = require('projen');

const project = new projen.JsiiProject({
  // ...
  
  secrets: projen.Secrets.fromAwsSecretsManager('arn:aws:secretsmanager:us-east-1:111111111111:secret:projen-publishing-tokens'),
  publishToPyPi: {
    distName: 'foo-bar',
    module: 'foo_bar',
  },
});
```

> NOTE: not sure I like the union-like API, but we can debate that later.

Now, as usual, execute `npx projen`.

Under the hood, projen uses `gh secret list` to check if your repo has the
desired secrets. If not, it will retrieve them from AWS Secrets Manager and
store them in your repository via the GitHub API.

```shell
$ npx projen
Synthesizing project...
Storing TWINE_USERNAME from arn:aws:secretsmanager:us-east-1:111111111111:secret:projen-publishing-tokens
Storing TWINE_PASSWORD from arn:aws:secretsmanager:us-east-1:111111111111:secret:projen-publishing-tokens
Done
```

_not sure that’s feasible:_ You will also notice that your
`.github/workflows/release.yml` workflow was updated and now includes a check
that verifies that your repository has the desired secrets. This is sort of an
"anti-tamper check" for external settings. If your repository does not have the
needed secrets, an error will be displayed with instructions on how to store
them.

A similar approach can be taken to configure other non-source-code repository
settings such as branch protection rules:

```js
# this should be the default probably
project.addBranchProtection(project.defaultBranch);
```

Similarly, during synth, given the proper credentials, projen can actually setup
the project to align with the definition and a workflow on the default branch
can be used to ensure that the project is compliant.

**Prerequisites:** For this to work, you'll need your development box to have
GitHub CLI installed and logged in, as well as default AWS credentials with
access to a secret called `projen-publishing-token` secret in `us-east-1` (as
defined by the ARN specified under `secrets`). Projen expects to find a field by
the same name as the secret name (e.g. `TWINE_USERNAME` and `TWINE_PASSWORD`)
stored in JSON format in the secret. Secrets can be stored using the AWS CLI or
via the AWS Console.

In the future we can offer a CLI command to store secrets:

```shell
$ projen secrets store TWINE_USERNAME "Boom"
$ projen secrets store TWINE_PASSWORD "Bam"
```

Something like that.

# Project Creation Prompts (RFC #1365)

> **Author**: [@MarkMcCulloh](https://github.com/MarkMcCulloh), **Status**: Draft

When hearing about projen for the first time, the typical comparisons one may think of are tools such as `yeoman` or the various projects making use of `npm init`.
Obviously the underlying methodology of projen is quite different, but there is a great UX feature these other tools typically employ that projen can make use of: Guided prompts. This allows users to create a project from an opinionated set of options with friendly guidance. This is especially useful in scenarios where the project requires a value that has no reasonable default (and thus could not be created with projen as it is now without it being provided as a CLI arg).

## Example user flows

Note: All prompts are assuming to be run from a TTY. We should check if in a TTY before a prompt is presented and error otherwise.

`$ npx projen new`
1. User is shown a list of base projen project types
1. User selects the `typescript` project
1. Project is synthesized

`$ npx projen new typescript`
1. No prompts are shown because a project is selected and the `typescript` project type has no `@featured` required options that do not also have a default
1. Project is synthesized

`$ npx projen new typescript --prompt`
1. Prompts are shown for (currently) `packageName` and `description`, as those options are `@featured` and have no default value
1. Project is synthesized

`$ npx projen new typescript --prompt --package-name cool-name --description 'Terse but useful'`
1. No prompts are shown because all `@featured` options have been given supplied values already
1. Project is synthesized

## Details

### Prompt library to use

[Prompts](https://github.com/terkelg/prompts) is an extremely common library for CLI-based prompts. It's relatively small and has very few dependencies.

### Project type prompt

A user should be prompted to select a project type to create. This should be prompted during `projen new` when:

- A project id has not been specified
- There is more than one project type available

Currently projen will exit and show the user the help menu. Instead, it should show the user a list of available projects to choose from in the current context. After choosing a project, projen can continue is it normally would have if the user has provided it during the original invocation.

[autocomplete](https://github.com/terkelg/prompts#autocompletemessage-choices-initial-suggest-limit-style) would be a good input type for this as it has a filtering feature.

### Project option prompts

After a project type has been selected, the user can be shown a list of featured options to set interactively. For a project option to be available as a prompt during `projen new`:

- `@featured` tag in property docstring
- Must be able to be set via CLI arg (is a primitive or enum)
- Must not have already been provided as a CLI arg

By default, `projen new <project>` will not show prompts unless the `--prompt` flag is provided.
There is one exception: If a project option meets the above criteria but is also:

- Non-nullable
- Not already provided as a CLI arg

### Prompt format

By default, values sent to the `prompts` library will be derived by the information in the JSII. For example, enums should have their choices populated automatically.

In case the default logic is insufficient,  `@prompt...` doc tags can be added to override the default. See below for reference.

#### Docstring tag reference

<https://github.com/terkelg/prompts#multiselectmessage-choices-initial-max-hint-warn>

- `@featured` - Functions as it did before, but now also signifies that this option is prompt-able
- `@promptType` - The type of prompt (text, toggle, etc.). See <https://github.com/terkelg/prompts#-types>.
  - **Example:** An array type would have a default prompt type of [list](https://github.com/terkelg/prompts#listmessage-initial).  
  `@promptType multiselect` would allow you to provide a set of distinct options instead.
- `@promptMessage` - The actual prompt, derived from the docstring summary. See <https://github.com/terkelg/prompts#message>.
  - Can be used when the type documentation insufficient for use as a prompt.
- `@promptChoices` - Comma-separated list of choices for this prompt.
  - Important for types that can't have their available choices automatically derived.  
  - **Example:** `@promptChoices choice1,choice2` would limit a plain text field into only have those two choices.

## Testing

`prompts` [provides a utility](https://github.com/terkelg/prompts#injectvalues) for injecting responses to prompts. This can be used for testing this functionality without any interaction.

## Documentation

Usage of `--prompt` should be mentioned in the README. Documentation on specifics of this feature should be added into `/docs`.

## Proposed implementation phases

To keep the implementation PRs small-ish:

1. Add `--prompt` flag to `projen new` that shows basic `text` prompts for `@featured` options
1. Show certain option prompts even when `--prompt` is not supplied (see above)
1. Add project type prompts
1. Derive specific option prompts (text, number, select, etc.) from JSII type info and `@prompt...` overrides

- **Always run build after changes**: After modifying any source or test file, run \`${projenCommand} build\` to ensure your changes compile and pass all tests.
- **Task completion criteria**: A task is not considered complete until:
  - All tests pass (\`${projenCommand} test\`)
  - There are no compilation errors (\`${projenCommand} compile\`)
  - There are no linting errors (usually part of the build, if not, run the linter defined in tasks.json)

  return `# Projen-managed Project Instructions

This project is managed by [projen](https://github.com/projen/projen), a project configuration management tool.

## Important Guidelines

### Task Execution

- **Always use projen for task execution**: Run tasks using \`${projenCommand} <task-name>\` instead of directly using npm, yarn, or other package managers.
- **Check available tasks**: Look in \`.projen/tasks.json\` to see all available tasks, their descriptions, and steps.
- **Common tasks**:
  - \`${projenCommand}\` - Synthesize project configuration files
  - \`${projenCommand} build\` - Builds the project, including running tests
  - \`${projenCommand} test\` - Runs tests only
  - \`${projenCommand} compile\` - Compiles the source code only

### File Modifications

- **DO NOT manually edit generated files**: Files marked with a comment like "~~ Generated by projen. To modify..." should never be edited directly.
- **Modify configuration in .projenrc**: To change project configuration, always edit the \`.projenrc.ts\`, \`.projenrc.py\` or \`.projenrc.json\` etc. file and then run \`${projenCommand}\` to regenerate the project files.
- **Check .projenrc first**: Before suggesting changes to package.json, tsconfig.json, or other configuration files, always check if these are managed by projen and suggest changes to .projenrc instead.

### Dependencies

- **Add dependencies through projen**: Use the projen configuration to add dependencies instead of manually editing package.json or using npm/yarn install directly.
- **Example**: In .projenrc, use methods like \`addDeps()\`, \`addDevDeps()\`, or \`addPeerDeps()\` to add dependencies.

### Workflow

1. Make changes to .projenrc configuration file
2. Run \`${projenCommand}\` to synthesize and update generated files
3. Review the changes
4. Commit both .projenrc and the generated files

## Projen Configuration

This project's configuration is defined in the .projenrc file at the root of the repository. All project metadata, dependencies, scripts, and tooling configuration should be managed through this file.
