# Harmonica

> Harmonica’s main purpose is to enable developers to create smooth, visually pleasing spring animations in Go applications without needing to implement the underlying physics themselves. It supports both graphical and terminal interfaces, making it versatile for games, UI animations, or interactive demos. The library abstracts complex mathematical models (damped harmonic oscillators) into intuitive parameters, allowing users to control motion speed, damping, and oscillation behavior with minimal code.

**Remember:**
- Damped harmonic oscillator
- Spring animation
- Angular frequency
- Damping ratio
- Time delta / framerate
- Under-damped, critically-damped, over-damped
