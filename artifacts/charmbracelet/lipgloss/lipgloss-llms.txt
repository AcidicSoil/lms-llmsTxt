# Lipgloss

> Lip Gloss aims to simplify the creation of visually appealing and structured terminal interfaces by offering a declarative, CSS-inspired style system for Go applications. It empowers developers to build consistent, aesthetically pleasing UIs without wrestling with terminal escape codes or layout calculations. The library is particularly useful in TUI frameworks like Bubble Tea and supports advanced features such as dynamic borders, adaptive colors, custom enumerators, and layout utilities (e.g., joining paragraphs, placing text in whitespace). It’s designed to be both powerful and intuitive, helping developers focus on application logic rather than formatting details.

**Remember:**
- Style
- Color Profiles (ANSI 16/256, True Color, Adaptive)
- Inline Formatting (Bold, Italic, Underline, etc.)
- Block-Level Formatting (Padding, Margins, Width/Height)
- Alignment (Left, Right, Center)
- Borders (Normal, Rounded, Custom, Shorthand)
