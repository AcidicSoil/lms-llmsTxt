# Lipgloss

> Lip Gloss aims to simplify the creation of visually appealing terminal interfaces by providing a CSS-like, declarative syntax for styling text and layout components. It empowers developers to focus on UI design rather than low-level rendering details. The library supports rich formatting including colors, borders, alignment, and adaptive styling across terminals, while also offering utilities for assembling complex layouts like tables, lists, and trees. Its modular structure allows easy integration into TUI frameworks and command-line applications.

**Remember:**
- Style
- Color Profiles (ANSI 16/256, True Color, Adaptive)
- Inline Formatting (Bold, Italic, Blink, etc.)
- Block-Level Formatting (Padding, Margins)
- Alignment (Left, Right, Center)
- Width & Height Constraints
