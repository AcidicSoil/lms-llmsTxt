# Fantasy

> Fantasy enables developers to construct AI agents in Go that can dynamically select from multiple providers and models, manage tools, and generate responses using a consistent API. Its primary goal is to simplify the development of intelligent agents by abstracting away provider-specific complexities while supporting advanced features like streaming, structured outputs, and tool integration. It’s currently being used to power Crush, a coding agent for developers.

**Remember:**
- AI Agent
- Multi-provider support
- Multi-model compatibility
- Tool integration
