# Gum

> Gum enables developers to create visually appealing and interactive shell scripts by abstracting away the complexity of terminal UI rendering. It empowers users to build tools like commit message generators, file pickers, and config managers with minimal code. The tool is especially useful for automation, CLI utilities, and improving user experience in shell environments without needing to write Go programs. Its modular design encourages reuse and customization via flags and environment variables.

**Remember:**
- Gum: A CLI tool for creating interactive shell scripts
- Bubbles: A library for terminal UI components (used by Gum)
- LipGloss: A styling library for terminal text formatting
- Command-based utilities: choose, confirm, input, write, etc
- Customization via flags and environment variables
- Terminal styling: foreground, background, borders, alignment
