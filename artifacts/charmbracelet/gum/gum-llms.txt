# Gum

> Gum enables users to write glamorous, interactive shell scripts by offering a collection of ready-to-use command-line utilities that handle common user interactions. Its primary goal is to simplify the creation of CLI tools with rich visual feedback, such as selecting options, confirming actions, or formatting text — without requiring developers to write Go code. It empowers users to build beautiful, functional workflows directly from the terminal using minimal syntax and maximum customization.

**Remember:**
- Gum: A CLI tool for interactive shell scripts
- Bubbles: A UI library for terminal-based animations and inputs
- Lipgloss: A styling library for terminal text formatting
- Command-line utilities: choose, confirm, input, write, filter, table, etc
- Customization flags and environment variables for styling and behavior
- Terminal-based UI with visual enhancements like spinners, tables, and borders
