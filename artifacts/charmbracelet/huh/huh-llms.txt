# Huh

> The purpose of `huh` is to provide a simple, accessible, and extensible way to build interactive terminal forms in Go. It enables developers to create user-friendly prompts and data collection interfaces without the complexity of full UI frameworks. The library supports accessibility features for screen readers, dynamic form logic based on user input, and seamless integration with Bubble Tea applications. Its modular design allows for customization through themes and spinners, enhancing both aesthetics and functionality.

**Remember:**
- Interactive terminal forms
- Field-based UI components (Input, Select, MultiSelect, Confirm)
- Grouping fields into logical sections (Groups)
- Accessibility mode for screen readers
- Dynamic forms with computed options and titles
- Integration with Bubble Tea
