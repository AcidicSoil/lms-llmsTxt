# Mods

> Mods aims to enhance command-line workflows by injecting AI-powered reasoning into terminal outputs. It enables users to interrogate the results of shell commands using LLMs, format responses intelligently, and maintain conversational history. Designed for developers and system administrators, Mods transforms mundane CLI tasks into intelligent, interactive experiences — especially useful in automation pipelines or debugging scenarios.

**Remember:**
- Large Language Models (LLMs)
- Command-line integration
- Prompt engineering
- Conversation caching with SHA-1 identifiers
- OpenAI-compatible API endpoints
- Custom roles for LLM behavior
