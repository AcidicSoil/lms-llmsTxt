# Glow

> Glow’s primary purpose is to bring the visual richness and functionality of markdown rendering to the terminal, enabling users to read, navigate, and interact with markdown documents directly in their CLI environment. It supports both TUI-based browsing (with pager-like navigation) and CLI-based processing, offering features like word wrapping, style customization, and configuration persistence. The project is built for developers and content creators who want to work with markdown without leaving the terminal.

**Remember:**
- Textual User Interface (TUI)
- Markdown rendering
- CLI command-line interface
- Style customization (via JSON or predefined styles)
- Word wrapping and paging
- Configurable settings via `glow.yml`
