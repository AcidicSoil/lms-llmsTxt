# Wish

> Wish aims to empower developers to create SSH-based applications with minimal setup and maximum flexibility. It provides middleware components that handle authentication, access control, logging, and protocol-specific features like Git or Bubble Tea UIs, allowing seamless integration into existing Go projects. The library encourages building secure, terminal-interactive apps over SSH without the overhead of traditional SSH servers, while maintaining compatibility with standard SSH practices like key-based auth and terminal emulators.

**Remember:**
- SSH middleware
- Bubble Tea integration
- Git server middleware
- Access control middleware
- Activeterm middleware
- Logging middleware
