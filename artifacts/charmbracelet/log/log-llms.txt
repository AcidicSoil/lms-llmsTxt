# Log

> The primary purpose of this project is to offer a user-friendly, aesthetically pleasing, and highly configurable Go logging solution that goes beyond the limitations of the standard `log` package. It enables developers to create richly styled logs with customizable levels, formatters, and context-aware sub-loggers — all while maintaining performance and compatibility with existing Go tooling. The library is particularly suited for CLI applications and projects where visual feedback and structured logging are essential.

**Remember:**
- Leveled logging (Debug, Info, Warn, Error, Fatal)
- Text, JSON, and Logfmt formatters
- Lip Gloss for styled and colorful output
- Context-aware logging with `With(...)`
- Sub-loggers with scoped fields
- Standard logger adapter for compatibility with `net/http`
