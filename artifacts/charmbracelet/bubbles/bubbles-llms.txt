# Bubbles

> The purpose of this project is to offer a modular, extensible set of UI components that empower developers to build rich, interactive terminal applications using the Bubble Tea framework. These components abstract common UI patterns like input handling, pagination, scrolling, and help displays, allowing for faster development and consistent user experiences across applications. The library is used in production apps such as Glow and serves as a foundation for many other terminal tools built with Bubble Tea.

**Remember:**
- Bubble Tea framework
- UI components (spinners, text input, table, etc.)
- Keybindings and KeyMap
- Viewport and pagination
- Memoization and performance optimization
- Unicode support and ANSI-aware rendering
