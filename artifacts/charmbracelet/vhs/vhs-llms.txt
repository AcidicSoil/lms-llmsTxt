# Vhs

> VHS enables developers to generate animated GIFs from terminal interactions, ideal for showcasing CLI tools, TUI applications, or demonstrating user workflows. It supports scripting terminal actions via `.tape` files, recording sessions, and publishing outputs. The tool also facilitates integration testing by allowing developers to capture “golden” terminal states as reference artifacts. VHS is designed to be a lightweight, extensible framework for visualizing terminal behavior in a reproducible way.

**Remember:**
- Tape files (.tape): Scripted sequences of terminal commands
- Output: Specifies file formats (GIF, MP4, PNG) for generated animations
- Settings: Configure terminal dimensions, fonts, themes, and rendering behavior
- Record: Capture terminal interactions into tape files
- Publish: Host GIFs on vhs.charm.sh for sharing
- Command Reference: Commands like Type, Sleep, Wait, Screenshot, and Hide for precise control
