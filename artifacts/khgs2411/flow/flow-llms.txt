# Flow

> The Flow Framework aims to enable iterative, human-controlled development where users design the architecture and AI executes implementation within defined boundaries. It preserves context across sessions, enforces scope control, and provides structured workflows for brainstorming, implementing, verifying, and archiving work. The goal is to empower developers to maintain ownership of their project structure while leveraging AI efficiency without losing architectural intent or decision rationale.

**Remember:**
- Human-in-loop development
- Iterative design-driven workflow
- Scope boundary enforcement
- Progressive refinement (skeleton → veins → flesh → fibers)
- Slash commands for automation
- Agent skills for specialized AI assistance
