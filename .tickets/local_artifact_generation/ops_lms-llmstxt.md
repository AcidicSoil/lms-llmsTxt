We need to add the capability for the following repo: [lms-llmtxt](https://github.com/AcidicSoil/lms-llmsTxt)

- ability to generate artifacts locally without a github url.

- similar to how [codefetch](https://github.com/regenrek/codefetch) generates artifacts.

- fix the private repo generating if not already(only if it no longer is working, verify with user)
